A digit wheel on a desk computing machine has ten stable positions and therefore has a storage capacity of one decimal digit. In analytical work where integration and differentiation are involved the base  $ e $ is sometimes useful. The resulting units of information will be called natural units. Change from the base  $ a $ to base  $ b $ merely requires multiplication by  $ \\log_b a $.\n\nBy a communication system we will mean a system of the type indicated schematically in Fig. 1. It consists of essentially five parts:\n\n1. An information source which produces a message or sequence of messages to be communicated to the receiving terminal. The message may be of various types: (a) A sequence of letters as in a telegraph of teletype system; (b) A single function of time  $ f(t) $ as in radio or telephony; (c) A function of time and other variables as in black and white television — here the message may be thought of as a function  $ f(x,y,t) $ of two space coordinates and time, the light intensity at point  $ (x,y) $ and time t on a pickup tube plate; (d) Two or more functions of time, say  $ f(t) $,  $ g(t) $,  $ h(t) $ — this is the case in “three-dimensional” sound transmission or if the system is intended to service several individual channels in multiplex; (e) Several functions of several variables — in color television the message consists of three functions  $ f(x,y,t) $,  $ g(x,y,t) $,  $ h(x,y,t) $ defined in a three-dimensional continuum — we may also think of these three functions as components of a vector field defined in the region — similarly, several black and white television sources would produce “messages” consisting of a number of functions of three variables; (f) Various combinations also occur, for example in television with an associated audio channel.\n\n2. A transmitter which operates on the message in some way to produce a signal suitable for transmission over the channel. In telephony this operation consists merely of changing sound pressure into a proportional electrical current. In telegraphy we have an encoding operation which produces a sequence of dots, dashes and spaces on the channel corresponding to the message. In a multiplex PCM system the different speech functions must be sampled, compressed, quantized and encoded, and finally interleaved properly to construct the signal. Vocoder systems, television and frequency modulation are other examples of complex operations applied to the message to obtain the signal.\n\n3. The channel is merely the medium used to transmit the signal from transmitter to receiver. It may be a pair of wires, a coaxial cable, a band of radio frequencies, a beam of light, etc.\n\n4. The receiver ordinarily performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal.\n\n5. The destination is the person (or thing) for whom the message is intended.\n\nWe wish to consider certain general problems involving communication systems.

counterparts. We may roughly classify communication systems into three main categories: discrete, continuous and mixed. By a discrete system we will mean one in which both the message and the signal are a sequence of discrete symbols. A typical case is telegraphy where the message is a sequence of letters and the signal a sequence of dots, dashes and spaces. A continuous system is one in which the message and signal are both treated as continuous functions, e.g., radio or television. A mixed system is one in which both discrete and continuous variables appear, e.g., PCM transmission of speech.\n\nWe first consider the discrete case. This case has applications not only in communication theory, but also in the theory of computing machines, the design of telephone exchanges and other fields. In addition, the discrete case forms a foundation for the continuous and mixed cases which will be treated in the second half of the paper.\n\n### PART I: DISCRETE NOISELESS SYSTEMS\n\n## 1. THE DISCRETE NOISELESS CHANNEL\n\nTeletype and telegraphy are two simple examples of a discrete channel for transmitting information. Generally, a discrete channel will mean a system whereby a sequence of choices from a finite set of elementary symbols  $ S_1, \\ldots, S_n $ can be transmitted from one point to another. Each of the symbols  $ S_i $ is assumed to have a certain duration in time  $ t_i $ seconds (not necessarily the same for different  $ S_i $, for example the dots and dashes in telegraphy). It is not required that all possible sequences of the  $ S_i $ be capable of transmission on the system; certain sequences only may be allowed. These will be possible signals for the channel. Thus in telegraphy suppose the symbols are: (1) A dot, consisting of line closure for a unit of time and then line open for a unit of time; (2) A dash, consisting of three time units of closure and one unit open; (3) A letter space consisting of, say, three units of line open; (4) A word space of six units of line open. We might place the restriction on allowable sequences that no spaces follow each other (for if two letter spaces are adjacent, it is identical with a word space). The question we now consider is how one can measure the capacity of such a channel to transmit information.\n\nIn the teletype case where all symbols are of the same duration, and any sequence of the 32 symbols is allowed the answer is easy. Each symbol represents five bits of information. If the system transmits n symbols per second it is natural to say that the channel has a capacity of 5n bits per second. This does not mean that the teletype channel will always be transmitting information at this rate — this is the maximum possible rate and whether or not the actual rate reaches this maximum depends on the source of information which feeds the channel, as will appear later.\n\nIn the more general case with different lengths of symbols and constraints on the allowed sequences, we make the following definition:\n\nDefinition: The capacity C of a discrete channel is given by\n\n $$ C=\\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\log N(T)}{T} $$ \n\nwhere N(T) is the number of allowed signals of duration T.\n\nIt is easily seen that in the teletype case this reduces to the previous result. It can be shown that the limit in question will exist as a finite number in most cases of interest. Suppose all sequences of the symbols  $ S_1, \\ldots, S_n $ are allowed and these symbols have durations  $ t_1, \\ldots, t_n $. What is the channel capacity? If  $ N(t) $ represents the number of sequences of duration  $ t $ we have\n\n $$ N(t)=N(t-t_{1})+N(t-t_{2})+\\cdots+N(t-t_{n}). $$ \n\nThe total number is equal to the sum of the numbers of sequences ending in $S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_n$ and these are $N(t - t_1), N(t - t_2), \\ldots, N(t - t_n)$, respectively. According to a well-known result in finite differences, $N(t)$ is then asymptotic for large $t$ to $X_0^t$ where $X_0$ is the largest real solution of the characteristic equation:\n\n $$ X^{-t_{1}}+X^{-t_{2}}+\\cdots+X^{-t_{n}}=1 $$ ","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_2.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A33Z%2F-1%2F%2F7a7d3801e6817273d5dc2f5e98461dbec76761c9ca06990f54de1202bf50b1ec"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_2.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A34Z%2F-1%2F%2F1ee87f6e7f0d99007a7ee615e102dd765dd58b02d1c59506d147dafb3d787561"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"text","block_content":"and therefore","block_bbox":[179,183,294,205],"block_id":0,"block_order":1,"group_id":0,"block_polygon_points":[[179.0,183.0],[293.0,183.0],[293.0,204.0],[179.0,204.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ C=\\log X_{0}. $$ ","block_bbox":[561,207,658,230],"block_id":1,"block_order":2,"group_id":1,"block_polygon_points":[[561.0,207.0],[657.0,207.0],[657.0,229.0],[561.0,229.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"In case there are restrictions on allowed sequences we may still often obtain a difference equation of this type and find C from the characteristic equation.

Solving this we find $C = 0.539$.\n\nA very general type of restriction which may be placed on allowed sequences is the following: We imagine a number of possible states  $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m $. For each state only certain symbols from the set  $ S_1, \\ldots, S_n $ can be transmitted (different subsets for the different states). When one of these has been transmitted the state changes to a new state depending both on the old state and the particular symbol transmitted. The telegraph case is a simple example of this. There are two states depending on whether or not a space was the last symbol transmitted. If so, then only a dot or a dash can be sent next and the state always changes. If not, any symbol can be transmitted and the state changes if a space is sent, otherwise it remains the same. The conditions can be indicated in a linear graph as shown in Fig. 2. The junction points correspond to the\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"imgs/img_in_image_box_486_626_715_804.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"18%\" /></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig. 2—Graphical representation of the constraints on telegraph symbols.</div>\n\n\nstates and the lines indicate the symbols possible in a state and the resulting state. In Appendix 1 it is shown that if the conditions on allowed sequences can be described in this form C will exist and can be calculated in accordance with the following result:\n\nTheorem 1: Let  $ b_{ij}^{(s)} $ be the duration of the  $ s^{th} $ symbol which is allowable in state i and leads to state j. Then the channel capacity C is equal to  $ \\log W $ where W is the largest real root of the determinant equation:\n\n $$ \\left|\\sum_{s}W^{-b_{ij}^{(s)}}-\\delta_{ij}\\right|=0 $$ \n\nwhere  $ \\delta_{ij} = 1 $ if i = j and is zero otherwise.\n\nFor example, in the telegraph case (Fig. 2) the determinant is:\n\n $$ \\begin{vmatrix}-1&(W^{-2}+W^{-4})\\ $ W^{-3}+W^{-6})&(W^{-2}+W^{-4}-1)\\end{vmatrix}=0. $$ \n\nOn expansion this leads to the equation given above for this case.\n\n## 2. THE DISCRETE SOURCE OF INFORMATION\n\nWe have seen that under very general conditions the logarithm of the number of possible signals in a discrete channel increases linearly with time. The capacity to transmit information can be specified by giving this rate of increase, the number of bits per second required to specify the particular signal used.\n\nWe now consider the information source.

The letter E occurs more frequently than Q, the sequence TH more frequently than XP, etc. The existence of this structure allows one to make a saving in time (or channel capacity) by properly encoding the message sequences into signal sequences. This is already done to a limited extent in telegraphy by using the shortest channel symbol, a dot, for the most common English letter E; while the infrequent letters, Q, X, Z are represented by longer sequences of dots and dashes. This idea is carried still further in certain commercial codes where common words and phrases are represented by four- or five-letter code groups with a considerable saving in average time.

In telegraphy, for example, the messages to be transmitted consist of sequences of letters. These sequences, however, are not completely random. In general, they form sentences and have the statistical structure of, say, English. The letter E occurs more frequently than Q, the sequence TH more frequently than XP, etc. The existence of this structure allows one to make a saving in time (or channel capacity) by properly encoding the message sequences into signal sequences. This is already done to a limited extent in telegraphy by using the shortest channel symbol, a dot, for the most common English letter E; while the infrequent letters, Q, X, Z are represented by longer sequences of dots and dashes. This idea is carried still further in certain commercial codes where common words and phrases are represented by four- or five-letter code groups with a considerable saving in average time. The standardized greeting and anniversary telegrams now in use extend this to the point of encoding a sentence or two into a relatively short sequence of numbers.\n\nWe can think of a discrete source as generating the message, symbol by symbol. It will choose successive symbols according to certain probabilities depending, in general, on preceding choices as well as the particular symbols in question. A physical system, or a mathematical model of a system which produces such a sequence of symbols governed by a set of probabilities, is known as a stochastic process. $ ^{3} $ We may consider a discrete source, therefore, to be represented by a stochastic process. Conversely, any stochastic process which produces a discrete sequence of symbols chosen from a finite set may be considered a discrete source. This will include such cases as:\n\n1. Natural written languages such as English, German, Chinese.\n\n2. Continuous information sources that have been rendered discrete by some quantizing process. For example, the quantized speech from a PCM transmitter, or a quantized television signal.\n\n3. Mathematical cases where we merely define abstractly a stochastic process which generates a sequence of symbols. The following are examples of this last type of source.\n\n(A) Suppose we have five letters A, B, C, D, E which are chosen each with probability .2, successive choices being independent. This would lead to a sequence of which the following is a typical example.\n\nBDCBCECCCADCBDDAAECEEA\n\nABBDAEECACEEBAEECBCEAD.\n\nThis was constructed with the use of a table of random numbers. $ ^{4} $\n\n(B) Using the same five letters let the probabilities be .4, .1, .2, .2, .1, respectively, with successive choices independent.

In the simplest case of this type a choice depends only on the preceding letter and not on ones before that. The statistical structure can then be described by a set of transition probabilities  $ p_i(j) $, the probability that letter  $ i $ is followed by letter  $ j $. The indices  $ i $ and  $ j $ range over all the possible symbols.

frequencies but no more. The choice of a letter would depend on the preceding two letters but not on the message before that point. A set of trigram frequencies  $ p(i,j,k) $ or equivalently a set of transition probabilities  $ p_{ij}(k) $ would be required. Continuing in this way one obtains successively more complicated stochastic processes. In the general n-gram case a set of n-gram probabilities  $ p(i_1,i_2,\\ldots,i_n) $ or of transition probabilities  $ p_{i_1,i_2,\\ldots,i_{n-1}}(i_n) $ is required to specify the statistical structure.\n\n(D) Stochastic processes can also be defined which produce a text consisting of a sequence of \"words.\" Suppose there are five letters A, B, C, D, E and 16 \"words\" in the language with associated probabilities:\n\n\n<table border=1 style='margin: auto; word-wrap: break-word;'><tr><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>.10 A</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>.16 BEBE</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>.11 CABED</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>.04 DEB</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>.04 ADEB</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>.04 BED</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>.05 CEED</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>.15 DEED</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>.05 ADEE</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>.02 BEED</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>.08 DAB</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>.01 EAB</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>.01 BADD</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>.05 CA</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>.04 DAD</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>.05 EE</td></tr></table>\n\nSuppose successive “words” are chosen independently and are separated by a space.

We may also generalize here and introduce transition probabilities between words, etc.\n\nThese artificial languages are useful in constructing simple problems and examples to illustrate various possibilities. We can also approximate to a natural language by means of a series of simple artificial languages. The zero-order approximation is obtained by choosing all letters with the same probability and independently. The first-order approximation is obtained by choosing successive letters independently but each letter having the same probability that it has in the natural language. $ ^{5} $ Thus, in the first-order approximation to English, E is chosen with probability .12 (its frequency in normal English) and W with probability .02, but there is no influence between adjacent letters and no tendency to form the preferred","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_5.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A35Z%2F-1%2F%2F4e175251d4720a17fc7e783dd537bbe323fd1b7f02b6a683422458991baf1e0d"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_5.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A35Z%2F-1%2F%2F231cc394c35c6f86911e214f9a839a7df3d32fb219ea5161d4e93d65f6418a7f"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"text","block_content":"digrams such as TH, ED, etc. In the second-order approximation, digram structure is introduced.

THE SERIES OF APPROXIMATIONS TO ENGLISH\n\nTo give a visual idea of how this series of processes approaches a language, typical sequences in the approximations to English have been constructed and are given below.

Note that these samples have reasonably good structure out to about twice the range that is taken into account in their construction. Thus in (3) the statistical process insures reasonable text for two-letter sequences, but four-letter sequences from the sample can usually be fitted into good sentences. In (6) sequences of four or more words can easily be placed in sentences without unusual or strained constructions. The particular sequence of ten words \"attack on an English writer that the character of this\" is not at all unreasonable. It appears then that a sufficiently complex stochastic process will give a satisfactory representation of a discrete source.\n\nThe first two samples were constructed by the use of a book of random numbers in conjunction with (for example 2) a table of letter frequencies. This method might have been continued for (3), (4) and (5), since digram, trigram and word frequency tables are available, but a simpler equivalent method was used.","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_6.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A35Z%2F-1%2F%2Fed1d1314394e06838d767defb5bcf7fb41fd3ed91d0866a82222c5896ee68518"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_6.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A36Z%2F-1%2F%2F0f621fb3a39656b6a82d91963349ae3d0f7361191f209d64fc4b2c20d193cdeb"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"text","block_content":"To construct (3) for example, one opens a book at random and selects a letter at random on the page.

This letter is recorded. The book is then opened to another page and one reads until this letter is encountered. The succeeding letter is then recorded. Turning to another page this second letter is searched for and the succeeding letter recorded, etc. A similar process was used for (4), (5) and (6). It would be interesting if further approximations could be constructed, but the labor involved becomes enormous at the next stage.\n\n## 4. GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF A MARKOFF PROCESS\n\nStochastic processes of the type described above are known mathematically as discrete Markoff processes and have been extensively studied in the literature. $ ^{6} $ The general case can be described as follows: There exist a finite number of possible “states” of a system;  $ S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_n $. In addition there is a set of transition probabilities;  $ p_i(j) $ the probability that if the system is in state  $ S_i $ it will next go to state  $ S_j $. To make this Markoff process into an information source we need only assume that a letter is produced for each transition from one state to another. The states will correspond to the “residue of influence” from preceding letters.\n\nThe situation can be represented graphically as shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. The “states” are the junction\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"imgs/img_in_image_box_511_560_710_733.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"16%\" /></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig. 3—A graph corresponding to the source in example B.</div>\n\n\npoints in the graph and the probabilities and letters produced for a transition are given beside the corresponding line. Figure 3 is for the example B in Section 2, while Fig. 4 corresponds to the example C. In Fig. 3\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"imgs/img_in_image_box_434_880_780_1042.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"28%\" /></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig. 4—A graph corresponding to the source in example C.</div>\n\n\nthere is only one state since successive letters are independent. In Fig. 4 there are as many states as letters. If a trigram example were constructed there would be at most  $ n^{2} $ states corresponding to the possible pairs of letters preceding the one being chosen. Figure 5 is a graph for the case of word structure in example D. Here S corresponds to the “space” symbol.\n\n## 5. ERGODIC AND MIXED SOURCES\n\nAs we have indicated above a discrete source for our purposes can be considered to be represented by a Markoff process. Among the possible discrete Markoff processes there is a group with special properties of significance in communication theory. This special class consists of the “ergodic” processes and we shall call the corresponding sources ergodic sources. Although a rigorous definition of an ergodic process is somewhat involved, the general idea is simple.

Thus the letter frequencies, digram frequencies, etc., obtained from particular sequences, will, as the lengths of the sequences increase, approach definite limits independent of the particular sequence. Actually this is not true of every sequence but the set for which it is false has probability zero. Roughly the ergodic property means statistical homogeneity.\n\nAll the examples of artificial languages given above are ergodic. This property is related to the structure of the corresponding graph. If the graph has the following two properties $ ^{7} $ the corresponding process will be ergodic:\n\n1. The graph does not consist of two isolated parts A and B such that it is impossible to go from junction points in part A to junction points in part B along lines of the graph in the direction of arrows and also impossible to go from junctions in part B to junctions in part A.\n\n2. A closed series of lines in the graph with all arrows on the lines pointing in the same orientation will be called a “circuit.” The “length” of a circuit is the number of lines in it. Thus in Fig. 5 series BEBES is a circuit of length 5. The second property required is that the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all circuits in the graph be one.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"imgs/img_in_image_box_371_574_852_982.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"39%\" /></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig. 5—A graph corresponding to the source in example D.</div>\n\n\nIf the first condition is satisfied but the second one violated by having the greatest common divisor equal to $d > 1$, the sequences have a certain type of periodic structure. The various sequences fall into $d$ different classes which are statistically the same apart from a shift of the origin (i.e., which letter in the sequence is called letter 1). By a shift of from 0 up to $d - 1$ any sequence can be made statistically equivalent to any other. A simple example with $d = 2$ is the following: There are three possible letters $a, b, c$. Letter $a$ is followed with either $b$ or $c$ with probabilities $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ respectively. Either $b$ or $c$ is always followed by letter $a$. Thus a typical sequence is\n\n $$ a b a c a c a c a b a c a b a b a c a c. $$ \n\nThis type of situation is not of much importance for our work.\n\nIf the first condition is violated the graph may be separated into a set of subgraphs each of which satisfies the first condition. We will assume that the second condition is also satisfied for each subgraph. We have in this case what may be called a “mixed” source made up of a number of pure components. The components correspond to the various subgraphs.

 $ p_{i} $ is the probability of the component source  $ L_{i} $.\n\nPhysically the situation represented is this: There are several different sources  $ L_{1}, L_{2}, L_{3}, \\ldots $ which are each of homogeneous statistical structure (i.e., they are ergodic). We do not know a priori which is to be used, but once the sequence starts in a given pure component  $ L_{i} $, it continues indefinitely according to the statistical structure of that component.\n\nAs an example one may take two of the processes defined above and assume  $ p_{1} = .2 $ and  $ p_{2} = .8 $. A sequence from the mixed source\n\n $$ L=.2L_{1}+.8L_{2} $$ \n\nwould be obtained by choosing first  $ L_{1} $ or  $ L_{2} $ with probabilities .2 and .8 and after this choice generating a sequence from whichever was chosen.\n\nExcept when the contrary is stated we shall assume a source to be ergodic. This assumption enables one to identify averages along a sequence with averages over the ensemble of possible sequences (the probability of a discrepancy being zero). For example the relative frequency of the letter A in a particular infinite sequence will be, with probability one, equal to its relative frequency in the ensemble of sequences.\n\nIf  $ P_i $ is the probability of state  $ i $ and  $ p_i(j) $ the transition probability to state  $ j $, then for the process to be stationary it is clear that the  $ P_i $ must satisfy equilibrium conditions:\n\n $$ P_{j}=\\sum_{i}P_{i}p_{i}(j). $$ \n\nIn the ergodic case it can be shown that with any starting conditions the probabilities  $ P_j(N) $ of being in state  $ j $ after  $ N $ symbols, approach the equilibrium values as  $ N \\to \\infty $.\n\n## 6. CHOICE, UNCERTAINTY AND ENTROPY\n\nWe have represented a discrete information source as a Markoff process. Can we define a quantity which will measure, in some sense, how much information is “produced” by such a process, or better, at what rate information is produced?\n\nSuppose we have a set of possible events whose probabilities of occurrence are  $ p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n $. These probabilities are known but that is all we know concerning which event will occur. Can we find a measure of how much “choice” is involved in the selection of the event or of how uncertain we are of the outcome?\n\nIf there is such a measure, say H(p1, p2, …, pn), it is reasonable to require of it the following properties:\n\n1. H should be continuous in the  $ p_{i} $.\n\n2. If all the  $ p_i $ are equal,  $ p_i = \\frac{1}{n} $, then  $ H $ should be a monotonic increasing function of  $ n $. With equally likely events there is more choice, or uncertainty, when there are more possible events.\n\n3. If a choice be broken down into two successive choices, the original H should be the weighted sum of the individual values of H. The meaning of this is illustrated in Fig. 6. At the left we have three\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"imgs/img_in_image_box_454_1091_760_1230.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"25%\" /></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig. 6—Decomposition of a choice from three possibilities.</div>\n\n\npossibilities $p_{1}=\\frac{1}{2}$, $p_{2}=\\frac{1}{3}$, $p_{3}=\\frac{1}{6}$. On the right we first choose between two possibilities each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$, and if the second occurs make another choice with probabilities $\\frac{2}{3}$, $\\frac{1}{3}$. The final results have the same probabilities as before. We require, in this special case, that\n\n $$ H(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{6})=H(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})+\\frac{1}{2}H(\\frac{2}{3},\\frac{1}{3}). $$ \n\nThe coefficient  $ \\frac{1}{2} $ is because this second choice only occurs half the time.","images":{"imgs/img_in_image_box_454_1091_760_1230.jpg":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/markdown_9/imgs/img_in_image_box_454_1091_760_1230.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A37Z%2F-1%2F%2F4928ff794d7e9e625e2429a4d4c89f46f1d58d774693a74f8f2920ed226f5c8e"}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_9.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A37Z%2F-1%2F%2Fc77a5ac4f2aa06d95578cc684710382cdee81894912c731d97389553303b96a9"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_9.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A37Z%2F-1%2F%2F9d745b3dad4eb9cb0a1bdd9884f4d5f323ac3fecf53bc32847fd9a4cf19a7aa0"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"text","block_content":"In Appendix 2, the following result is established:","block_bbox":[209,182,616,206],"block_id":0,"block_order":1,"group_id":0,"block_polygon_points":[[209.0,182.0],[616.0,182.0],[616.0,206.0],[209.0,206.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"Theorem 2: The only H satisfying the three above assumptions is of the form:","block_bbox":[208,213,843,237],"block_id":1,"block_order":2,"group_id":1,"block_polygon_points":[[208.0,213.0],[843.0,213.0],[843.0,237.0],[208.0,237.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ H=-K\\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}\\log p_{i} $$ ","block_bbox":[524,252,695,306],"block_id":2,"block_order":3,"group_id":2,"block_polygon_points":[[524.0,252.0],[695.0,252.0],[695.0,306.0],[524.0,306.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"where K is a positive constant.","block_bbox":[179,320,431,343],"block_id":3,"block_order":4,"group_id":3,"block_polygon_points":[[179.0,320.0],[431.0,320.0],[431.0,343.0],[179.0,343.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"This theorem, and the assumptions required for its proof, are in no way necessary for the present theory.

THE ENTROPY OF AN INFORMATION SOURCE\n\nConsider a discrete source of the finite state type considered above. For each possible state $i$ there will be a set of probabilities $p_i(j)$ of producing the various possible symbols $j$. Thus there is an entropy $H_i$ for each state. The entropy of the source will be defined as the average of these $H_i$ weighted in accordance with the probability of occurrence of the states in question:\n\n $$ \\begin{aligned}H&=\\sum_{i}P_{i}H_{i}\\\\&=-\\sum_{i,j}P_{i}p_{i}(j)\\log p_{i}(j).\\end{aligned} $$ \n\nThis is the entropy of the source per symbol of text. If the Markoff process is proceeding at a definite time rate there is also an entropy per second\n\n $$ H^{\\prime}=\\sum_{i}f_{i}H_{i} $$ \n\nwhere  $ f_{i} $ is the average frequency (occurrences per second) of state i. Clearly\n\n $$ H^{\\prime}=m H $$ \n\nwhere m is the average number of symbols produced per second. H or  $ H' $ measures the amount of information generated by the source per symbol or per second. If the logarithmic base is 2, they will represent bits per symbol or per second.\n\nIf successive symbols are independent then $H$ is simply $-\\sum p_i \\log p_i$ where $p_i$ is the probability of symbol $i$. Suppose in this case we consider a long message of $N$ symbols. It will contain with high probability about $p_1 N$ occurrences of the first symbol, $p_2 N$ occurrences of the second, etc. Hence the probability of this particular message will be roughly\n\n $$ p=p_{1}^{p_{1}N}p_{2}^{p_{2}N}\\cdots p_{n}^{p_{n}N} $$ \n\nor\n\n $$ \\log p\\doteq N\\sum_{i}p_{i}\\log p_{i} $$ \n\n $$ \\log p\\doteq-N H $$ \n\n $$ H\\doteq\\frac{\\log1/p}{N}. $$ \n\nH is thus approximately the logarithm of the reciprocal probability of a typical long sequence divided by the number of symbols in the sequence. The same result holds for any source. Stated more precisely we have (see Appendix 3):\n\nTheorem 3: Given any  $ \\epsilon > 0 $ and  $ \\delta > 0 $, we can find an  $ N_0 $ such that the sequences of any length  $ N \\geq N_0 $ fall into two classes:\n\n1. A set whose total probability is less than  $ \\epsilon $.\n\n2. The remainder, all of whose members have probabilities satisfying the inequality\n\n $$ \\left|\\frac{\\log p^{-1}}{N}-H\\right|<\\delta. $$ \n\nIn other words we are almost certain to have  $ \\frac{\\log p}{N} $ very close to H when N is large.\n\nA closely related result deals with the number or sequences of various probabilities. Consider again the sequences of length N and let them be arranged in order of decreasing probability. We define  $ n(q) $ to be the number we must take from this set starting with the most probable one in order to accumulate a total probability q for those taken.","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_12.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A40Z%2F-1%2F%2Fa8c8f6dc9941668905472e73415575ce604fa76efb3619a9b743da97b086071a"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_12.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A40Z%2F-1%2F%2F12bcb2e96fff1ee4fb140cb297fbd7f128ef0297df253bb8d47817856ba86045"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"header","block_content":"Theorem 4:","block_bbox":[210,183,308,205],"block_id":0,"group_id":0,"block_polygon_points":[[210.0,182.99998474121094],[307.0,182.99998474121094],[307.0,203.99998474121094],[210.0,203.99998474121094]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ \\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\log n(q)}{N}=H $$ ","block_bbox":[533,199,689,248],"block_id":1,"block_order":1,"group_id":1,"block_polygon_points":[[533.0,199.0],[689.0,199.0],[689.0,248.0],[533.0,248.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"when q does not equal 0 or 1.","block_bbox":[179,255,420,279],"block_id":2,"block_order":2,"group_id":2,"block_polygon_points":[[179.0,255.0],[420.0,255.0],[420.0,279.0],[179.0,279.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"We may interpret  $ \\log n(q) $ as the number of bits required to specify the sequence when we consider only the most probable sequences with a total probability  $ q $.

$$ \\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\log n(q)}{N}=H $$ \n\nwhen q does not equal 0 or 1.\n\nWe may interpret  $ \\log n(q) $ as the number of bits required to specify the sequence when we consider only the most probable sequences with a total probability  $ q $. Then  $ \\frac{\\log n(q)}{N} $ is the number of bits per symbol for the specification. The theorem says that for large  $ N $ this will be independent of  $ q $ and equal to  $ H $. The rate of growth of the logarithm of the number of reasonably probable sequences is given by  $ H $, regardless of our interpretation of “reasonably probable.” Due to these results, which are proved in Appendix 3, it is possible for most purposes to treat the long sequences as though there were just  $ 2^{HN} $ of them, each with a probability  $ 2^{-HN} $.\n\nThe next two theorems show that  $ H $ and  $ H' $ can be determined by limiting operations directly from the statistics of the message sequences, without reference to the states and transition probabilities between states.\n\nTheorem 5: Let  $ p(B_i) $ be the probability of a sequence  $ B_i $ of symbols from the source. Let\n\n $$ G_{N}=-\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i}p(B_{i})\\log p(B_{i}) $$ \n\nwhere the sum is over all sequences  $ B_i $ containing N symbols.

Let\n\n $$ F_{N}=-\\sum_{i,j}p(B_{i},S_{j})\\log p_{B_{i}}(S_{j}) $$ \n\nwhere the sum is over all blocks  $ B_i $ of  $ N - 1 $ symbols and over all symbols  $ S_j $.

They show that a series of approximations to $H$ can be obtained by considering only the statistical structure of the sequences extending over $1,2,\\ldots,N$ symbols. $F_N$ is the better approximation. In fact $F_N$ is the entropy of the $N^{\\mathrm{th}}$ order approximation to the source of the type discussed above. If there are no statistical influences extending over more than $N$ symbols, that is if the conditional probability of the next symbol knowing the preceding $(N-1)$ is not changed by a knowledge of any before that, then $F_N = H$. $F_N$ of course is the conditional entropy of the next symbol when the $(N-1)$ preceding ones are known, while $G_N$ is the entropy per symbol of blocks of $N$ symbols.\n\nThe ratio of the entropy of a source to the maximum value it could have while still restricted to the same symbols will be called its relative entropy. This is the maximum compression possible when we encode into the same alphabet. One minus the relative entropy is the redundancy. The redundancy of ordinary English, not considering statistical structure over greater distances than about eight letters, is roughly 50%.

neighborhood. One is by calculation of the entropy of the approximations to English. A second method is to delete a certain fraction of the letters from a sample of English text and then let someone attempt to restore them. If they can be restored when 50% are deleted the redundancy must be greater than 50%. A third method depends on certain known results in cryptography.\n\nTwo extremes of redundancy in English prose are represented by Basic English and by James Joyce's book \"Finnegans Wake\". The Basic English vocabulary is limited to 850 words and the redundancy is very high. This is reflected in the expansion that occurs when a passage is translated into Basic English. Joyce on the other hand enlarges the vocabulary and is alleged to achieve a compression of semantic content.\n\nThe redundancy of a language is related to the existence of crossword puzzles. If the redundancy is zero any sequence of letters is a reasonable text in the language and any two-dimensional array of letters forms a crossword puzzle. If the redundancy is too high the language imposes too many constraints for large crossword puzzles to be possible. A more detailed analysis shows that if we assume the constraints imposed by the language are of a rather chaotic and random nature, large crossword puzzles are just possible when the redundancy is 50%. If the redundancy is 33%, three-dimensional crossword puzzles should be possible, etc.\n\n## 8. REPRESENTATION OF THE ENCODING AND DECODING OPERATIONS\n\nWe have yet to represent mathematically the operations performed by the transmitter and receiver in encoding and decoding the information. Either of these will be called a discrete transducer. The input to the transducer is a sequence of input symbols and its output a sequence of output symbols. The transducer may have an internal memory so that its output depends not only on the present input symbol but also on the past history. We assume that the internal memory is finite, i.e., there exist a finite number m of possible states of the transducer and that its output is a function of the present state and the present input symbol. The next state will be a second function of these two quantities. Thus a transducer can be described by two functions:\n\n $$ y_{n}=f(x_{n},\\alpha_{n}) $$ \n\n $$ \\alpha_{n+1}=g(x_{n},\\alpha_{n}) $$ \n\nwhere\n\n $ x_n $ is the  $ n^{\\text{th}} $ input symbol,\n\n $ \\alpha_{n} $ is the state of the transducer when the  $ n^{th} $ input symbol is introduced,\n\n $ y_{n} $ is the output symbol (or sequence of output symbols) produced when  $ x_{n} $ is introduced if the state is  $ \\alpha_{n} $.\n\nIf the output symbols of one transducer can be identified with the input symbols of a second, they can be connected in tandem and the result is also a transducer. If there exists a second transducer which operates on the output of the first and recovers the original input, the first transducer will be called non-singular and the second will be called its inverse.\n\nTheorem 7: The output of a finite state transducer driven by a finite state statistical source is a finite state statistical source, with entropy (per unit time) less than or equal to that of the input. If the transducer is non-singular they are equal.\n\nLet  $ \\alpha $ represent the state of the source, which produces a sequence of symbols  $ x_i $; and let  $ \\beta $ be the state of the transducer, which produces, in its output, blocks of symbols  $ y_j $. The combined system can be represented by the “product state space” of pairs  $ (\\alpha, \\beta) $. Two points in the space  $ (\\alpha_1, \\beta_1) $ and  $ (\\alpha_2, \\beta_2) $, are connected by a line if  $ \\alpha_1 $ can produce an  $ x $ which changes  $ \\beta_1 $ to  $ \\beta_2 $, and this line is given the probability of that  $ x $ in this case. The line is labeled with the block of  $ y_j $ symbols produced by the transducer. The entropy of the output can be calculated as the weighted sum over the states. If we sum first on  $ \\beta $ each resulting term is less than or equal to the corresponding term for  $ \\alpha $, hence the entropy is not increased. If the transducer is non-singular let its output be connected to the inverse transducer. If  $ H_1', H_2' $ and  $ H_3' $ are the output entropies of the source, the first and second transducers respectively, then  $ H_1' \\geq H_2' \\geq H_3' = H_1' $ and therefore  $ H_1' = H_2' $.","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_14.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A41Z%2F-1%2F%2F22b73f638b4c4037e480e0282646c59b14b34e8e369fa20d9a926d2fa9b6e68a"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_14.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A41Z%2F-1%2F%2F96445f7f8e2702c7caa54a6e2fc1496cafcd283c59c6d3fca83347d07605dfde"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"text","block_content":"Suppose we have a system of constraints on possible sequences of the type which can be represented by a linear graph as in Fig. 2.

The high probability group is coded in an arbitrary one-to-one way into this set. The remaining sequences are represented by larger sequences, starting and ending with one of the sequences not used for the high probability group.

N increases δ, λ and φ approach zero and the rate approaches  $ \\frac{C}{H} $.\n\nAnother method of performing this coding and thereby proving the theorem can be described as follows: Arrange the messages of length N in order of decreasing probability and suppose their probabilities are  $ p_1 \\geq p_2 \\geq p_3 \\cdots \\geq p_n $. Let  $ P_s = \\sum_1^{s-1} p_i $; that is  $ P_s $ is the cumulative probability up to, but not including,  $ p_s $. We first encode into a binary system. The binary code for message  $ s $ is obtained by expanding  $ P_s $ as a binary number. The expansion is carried out to  $ m_s $ places, where  $ m_s $ is the integer satisfying:\n\n $$ \\log_{2}\\frac{1}{p_{s}}\\leq m_{s}<1+\\log_{2}\\frac{1}{p_{s}}. $$ \n\nThus the messages of high probability are represented by short codes and those of low probability by long codes. From these inequalities we have\n\n $$ \\frac{1}{2m_{s}}\\leq p_{s}<\\frac{1}{2^{m_{s}-1}}. $$ \n\nThe code for  $ P_s $ will differ from all succeeding ones in one or more of its  $ m_s $ places, since all the remaining  $ P_i $ are at least  $ \\frac{1}{2m_s} $ larger and their binary expansions therefore differ in the first  $ m_s $ places. Consequently all the codes are different and it is possible to recover the message from its code. If the channel sequences are not already sequences of binary digits, they can be ascribed binary numbers in an arbitrary fashion and the binary code thus translated into signals suitable for the channel.\n\nThe average number  $ H' $ of binary digits used per symbol of original message is easily estimated. We have\n\n $$ H^{\\prime}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum m_{s}p_{s}. $$ \n\nBut,\n\n $$ \\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\left(\\log_{2}\\frac{1}{p_{s}}\\right)p_{s}\\leq\\frac{1}{N}\\sum m_{s}p_{s}<\\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\left(1+\\log_{2}\\frac{1}{p_{s}}\\right)p_{s} $$ \n\nand therefore,\n\n $$ G_{N}\\leq H^{\\prime}<G_{N}+\\frac{1}{N} $$ \n\nAs N increases  $ G_{N} $ approaches H, the entropy of the source and  $ H' $ approaches H.\n\nWe see from this that the inefficiency in coding, when only a finite delay of N symbols is used, need not be greater than  $ \\frac{1}{N} $ plus the difference between the true entropy H and the entropy  $ G_{N} $ calculated for sequences of length N. The per cent excess time needed over the ideal is therefore less than\n\n $$ \\frac{G_{N}}{H}+\\frac{1}{H N}-1. $$ \n\nThis method of encoding is substantially the same as one found independently by R. M. Fano. $ ^{9} $ His method is to arrange the messages of length N in order of decreasing probability. Divide this series into two groups of as nearly equal probability as possible. If the message is in the first group its first binary digit will be 0, otherwise 1. The groups are similarly divided into subsets of nearly equal probability and the particular subset determines the second binary digit. This process is continued until each subset contains only one message. It is easily seen that apart from minor differences (generally in the last digit) this amounts to the same thing as the arithmetic process described above.\n\n## 10. Discussion and Examples\n\nIn order to obtain the maximum power transfer from a generator to a load, a transformer must in general be introduced so that the generator as seen from the load has the load resistance. The situation here is roughly analogous. The transducer which does the encoding should match the source to the channel in a statistical sense. The source as seen from the channel through the transducer should have the same statistical structure.","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_16.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A43Z%2F-1%2F%2F2d22ace05caac6ba440740e5a75201bba140feceed502b42d4147ac6adde88f1"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_16.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A43Z%2F-1%2F%2Fc6919531cac176b713a810948e7031706b052288de07249d789d19052ae29152"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"text","block_content":"as the source which maximizes the entropy in the channel.

The content of Theorem 9 is that, although an exact match is not in general possible, we can approximate it as closely as desired. The ratio of the actual rate of transmission to the capacity C may be called the efficiency of the coding system. This is of course equal to the ratio of the actual entropy of the channel symbols to the maximum possible entropy.\n\nIn general, ideal or nearly ideal encoding requires a long delay in the transmitter and receiver. In the noiseless case which we have been considering, the main function of this delay is to allow reasonably good matching of probabilities to corresponding lengths of sequences. With a good code the logarithm of the reciprocal probability of a long message must be proportional to the duration of the corresponding signal, in fact\n\n $$ \\left|\\frac{\\log p^{-1}}{T}-C\\right| $$ \n\nmust be small for all but a small fraction of the long messages.\n\nIf a source can produce only one particular message its entropy is zero, and no channel is required. For example, a computing machine set up to calculate the successive digits of  $ \\pi $ produces a definite sequence with no chance element. No channel is required to “transmit” this to another point. One could construct a second machine to compute the same sequence at the point. However, this may be impractical. In such a case we can choose to ignore some or all of the statistical knowledge we have of the source. We might consider the digits of  $ \\pi $ to be a random sequence in that we construct a system capable of sending any sequence of digits. In a similar way we may choose to use some of our statistical knowledge of English in constructing a code, but not all of it. In such a case we consider the source with the maximum entropy subject to the statistical conditions we wish to retain. The entropy of this source determines the channel capacity which is necessary and sufficient. In the  $ \\pi $ example the only information retained is that all the digits are chosen from the set 0, 1, ..., 9. In the case of English one might wish to use the statistical saving possible due to letter frequencies, but nothing else. The maximum entropy source is then the first approximation to English and its entropy determines the required channel capacity.\n\nAs a simple example of some of these results consider a source which produces a sequence of letters chosen from among A, B, C, D with probabilities  $ \\frac{1}{2} $,  $ \\frac{1}{4} $,  $ \\frac{1}{8} $,  $ \\frac{1}{8} $, successive symbols being chosen independently. We have\n\n $$ \\begin{aligned}H&=-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\log\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}\\log\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{2}{8}\\log\\frac{1}{8}\\right)\\\\&=\\frac{7}{4}\\mathrm{bits per symbol}.\\end{aligned} $$ \n\nThus we can approximate a coding system to encode messages from this source into binary digits with an average of  $ \\frac{7}{4} $ binary digit per symbol. In this case we can actually achieve the limiting value by the following code (obtained by the method of the second proof of Theorem 9):\n\n $$ \\begin{array}{ccc}{{{A}}}&{{{0}}} \\\\{{{B}}}&{{{10}}} \\\\{{{C}}}&{{{110}}} \\\\{{{D}}}&{{{111}}} \\\\\\end{array} $$ \n\nThe average number of binary digits used in encoding a sequence of N symbols will be\n\n $$ N\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\times1+\\frac{1}{4}\\times2+\\frac{2}{8}\\times3\\right)=\\frac{7}{4}N. $$ \n\nIt is easily seen that the binary digits 0, 1 have probabilities  $ \\frac{1}{2} $,  $ \\frac{1}{2} $ so the H for the coded sequences is one bit per symbol.

This could be indicated by the binary representation with all numbers containing the special sequence deleted. All numbers up to 16 are represented as usual; 16 is represented by the next binary number after 16 which does not contain four zeros, namely 17 = 10001, etc.\n\nIt can be shown that as  $ p \\to 0 $ the coding approaches ideal provided the length of the special sequence is properly adjusted.\n\n## PART II: THE DISCRETE CHANNEL WITH NOISE\n\n## 11. REPRESENTATION OF A NOISY DISCRETE CHANNEL\n\nWe now consider the case where the signal is perturbed by noise during transmission or at one or the other of the terminals. This means that the received signal is not necessarily the same as that sent out by the transmitter. Two cases may be distinguished. If a particular transmitted signal always produces the same received signal, i.e., the received signal is a definite function of the transmitted signal, then the effect may be called distortion. If this function has an inverse — no two transmitted signals producing the same received signal — distortion may be corrected, at least in principle, by merely performing the inverse functional operation on the received signal.\n\nThe case of interest here is that in which the signal does not always undergo the same change in transmission. In this case we may assume the received signal E to be a function of the transmitted signal S and a second variable, the noise N.\n\n $$ E=f(S,N) $$ \n\nThe noise is considered to be a chance variable just as the message was above. In general it may be represented by a suitable stochastic process. The most general type of noisy discrete channel we shall consider is a generalization of the finite state noise-free channel described previously. We assume a finite number of states and a set of probabilities\n\n $$ p_{\\alpha,i}(\\beta,j). $$ \n\nThis is the probability, if the channel is in state  $ \\alpha $ and symbol  $ i $ is transmitted, that symbol  $ j $ will be received and the channel left in state  $ \\beta $. Thus  $ \\alpha $ and  $ \\beta $ range over the possible states,  $ i $ over the possible transmitted signals and  $ j $ over the possible received signals. In the case where successive symbols are independently perturbed by the noise there is only one state, and the channel is described by the set of transition probabilities  $ p_i(j) $, the probability of transmitted symbol  $ i $ being received as  $ j $.\n\nIf a noisy channel is fed by a source there are two statistical processes at work: the source and the noise. Thus there are a number of entropies that can be calculated. First there is the entropy  $ H(x) $ of the source or of the input to the channel (these will be equal if the transmitter is non-singular). The entropy of the output of the channel, i.e., the received signal, will be denoted by  $ H(y) $. In the noiseless case  $ H(y) = H(x) $. The joint entropy of input and output will be  $ H(xy) $. Finally there are two conditional entropies  $ H_x(y) $ and  $ H_y(x) $, the entropy of the output when the input is known and conversely. Among these quantities we have the relations\n\n $$ H(x,y)=H(x)+H_{x}(y)=H(y)+H_{y}(x). $$ \n\nAll of these entropies can be measured on a per-second or a per-symbol basis.","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_18.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A44Z%2F-1%2F%2F7b475470b70def5eb6dca783382919abb433ef730e9ddbe4d6a680b21dfc1dc8"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_18.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A44Z%2F-1%2F%2F079a69ce1035ea150df3abda668f1a475521822b02ef4b570e88733fd7eb7a53"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"paragraph_title","block_content":"## 12.

Certainly less than 1000 bits per second since about 1% of the received symbols are incorrect. Our first impulse might be to say the rate is 990 bits per second, merely subtracting the expected number of errors.

Equivocation and Channel Capacity\n\nIf the channel is noisy it is not in general possible to reconstruct the original message or the transmitted signal with certainty by any operation on the received signal E. There are, however, ways of transmitting the information which are optimal in combating noise. This is the problem which we now consider.\n\nSuppose there are two possible symbols 0 and 1, and we are transmitting at a rate of 1000 symbols per second with probabilities  $ p_0 = p_1 = \\frac{1}{2} $. Thus our source is producing information at the rate of 1000 bits per second. During transmission the noise introduces errors so that, on the average, 1 in 100 is received incorrectly (a 0 as 1, or 1 as 0). What is the rate of transmission of information? Certainly less than 1000 bits per second since about 1% of the received symbols are incorrect. Our first impulse might be to say the rate is 990 bits per second, merely subtracting the expected number of errors. This is not satisfactory since it fails to take into account the recipient's lack of knowledge of where the errors occur. We may carry it to an extreme case and suppose the noise so great that the received symbols are entirely independent of the transmitted symbols. The probability of receiving 1 is  $ \\frac{1}{2} $ whatever was transmitted and similarly for 0. Then about half of the received symbols are correct due to chance alone, and we would be giving the system credit for transmitting 500 bits per second while actually no information is being transmitted at all. Equally “good” transmission would be obtained by dispensing with the channel entirely and flipping a coin at the receiving point.\n\nEvidently the proper correction to apply to the amount of information transmitted is the amount of this information which is missing in the received signal, or alternatively the uncertainty when we have received a signal of what was actually sent. From our previous discussion of entropy as a measure of uncertainty it seems reasonable to use the conditional entropy of the message, knowing the received signal, as a measure of this missing information. This is indeed the proper definition, as we shall see later. Following this idea the rate of actual transmission, R, would be obtained by subtracting from the rate of production (i.e., the entropy of the source) the average rate of conditional entropy.\n\n $$ R=H(x)-H_{y}(x) $$ \n\nThe conditional entropy  $ H_{y}(x) $ will, for convenience, be called the equivocation. It measures the average ambiguity of the received signal.\n\nIn the example considered above, if a 0 is received the a posteriori probability that a 0 was transmitted is .99, and that a 1 was transmitted is .01. These figures are reversed if a 1 is received. Hence\n\n $$ \\begin{aligned}H_{y}(x)&=-[.99\\log.99+0.01\\log0.01]\\\\&=.081\\ bits/symbol\\end{aligned} $$ \n\nor 81 bits per second. We may say that the system is transmitting at a rate 1000 - 81 = 919 bits per second. In the extreme case where a 0 is equally likely to be received as a 0 or 1 and similarly for 1, the a posteriori probabilities are  $ \\frac{1}{2} $,  $ \\frac{1}{2} $ and\n\n $$ \\begin{aligned}H_{y}(x)&=-\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\log\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\log\\frac{1}{2}\\right]\\\\&=1\\ bit per symbol\\end{aligned} $$ \n\nor 1000 bits per second. The rate of transmission is then 0 as it should be.\n\nThe following theorem gives a direct intuitive interpretation of the equivocation and also serves to justify it as the unique appropriate measure. We consider a communication system and an observer (or auxiliary device) who can see both what is sent and what is recovered (with errors due to noise). This observer notes the errors in the recovered message and transmits data to the receiving point over a “correction channel” to enable the receiver to correct the errors. The situation is indicated schematically in Fig. 8.\n\nTheorem 10: If the correction channel has a capacity equal to  $ H_y(x) $ it is possible to so encode the correction data as to send it over this channel and correct all but an arbitrarily small fraction  $ \\epsilon $ of the errors. This is not possible if the channel capacity is less than  $ H_y(x) $.","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_19.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A44Z%2F-1%2F%2Fda65a2117f10b3d015c1cecb1c6389642724220cef1487b3c346ca470cd34711"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_19.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A45Z%2F-1%2F%2F25692f06ccc78c6c02d1b8fa5c97486f2cdd544bab60ddc220d6fb8b15d195e4"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"image","block_content":"<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"imgs/img_in_image_box_288_172_932_507.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"52%\" /></div>\n","block_bbox":[288,172,932,507],"block_id":0,"group_id":0,"block_polygon_points":[[288.0,172.0],[932.0,172.0],[932.0,507.0],[288.0,507.0]]},{"block_label":"figure_title","block_content":"<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig. 8—Schematic diagram of a correction system.</div>\n","block_bbox":[421,529,799,551],"block_id":1,"group_id":1,"block_polygon_points":[[421.0,529.0],[799.0,529.0],[799.0,551.0],[421.0,551.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"Roughly then,  $ H_{y}(x) $ is the amount of additional information that must be supplied per second at the receiving point to correct the received message.","block_bbox":[179,590,1041,637],"block_id":2,"block_order":1,"group_id":2,"block_polygon_points":[[179.0,590.0],[1041.0,590.0],[1041.0,637.0],[179.0,637.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"To prove the first part, consider long sequences of received message  $ M' $ and corresponding original message  $ M $.

correction system.</div>\n\n\nRoughly then,  $ H_{y}(x) $ is the amount of additional information that must be supplied per second at the receiving point to correct the received message.\n\nTo prove the first part, consider long sequences of received message  $ M' $ and corresponding original message  $ M $. There will be logarithmically  $ TH_y(x) $ of the  $ M' $s which could reasonably have produced each  $ M' $. Thus we have  $ TH_y(x) $ binary digits to send each  $ T $ seconds. This can be done with  $ \\epsilon $ frequency of errors on a channel of capacity  $ H_y(x) $.\n\nThe second part can be proved by noting, first, that for any discrete chance variables x, y, z\n\n $$ H_{y}(x,z)\\geq H_{y}(x). $$ \n\nThe left-hand side can be expanded to give\n\n $$ \\begin{align*}H_{\\mathrm{y}}(z)+H_{\\mathrm{yz}}(x)&\\geq H_{\\mathrm{y}}(x)\\\\H_{\\mathrm{yz}}(x)&\\geq H_{\\mathrm{y}}(x)-H_{\\mathrm{y}}(z)\\geq H_{\\mathrm{y}}(x)-H(z).\\end{align*} $$ \n\nIf we identify $x$ as the output of the source, $y$ as the received signal and $z$ as the signal sent over the correction channel, then the right-hand side is the equivocation less the rate of transmission over the correction channel. If the capacity of this channel is less than the equivocation the right-hand side will be greater than zero and $H_{yz}(x) > 0$. But this is the uncertainty of what was sent, knowing both the received signal and the correction signal. If this is greater than zero the frequency of errors cannot be arbitrarily small.\n\n### Example:\n\nSuppose the errors occur at random in a sequence of binary digits: probability p that a digit is wrong and  $ q = 1 - p $ that it is right. These errors can be corrected if their position is known. Thus the correction channel need only send information as to these positions. This amounts to transmitting from a source which produces binary digits with probability p for 1 (incorrect) and q for 0 (correct). This requires a channel of capacity\n\n $$ -[p\\log p+q\\log q] $$ \n\nwhich is the equivocation of the original system.\n\nThe rate of transmission R can be written in two other forms due to the identities noted above. We have\n\n $$ \\begin{aligned}R&=H(x)-H_{y}(x)\\\\&=H(y)-H_{x}(y)\\\\&=H(x)+H(y)-H(x,y).\\end{aligned} $$ ","images":{"imgs/img_in_image_box_288_172_932_507.jpg":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/markdown_20/imgs/img_in_image_box_288_172_932_507.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A45Z%2F-1%2F%2F3654717672f0bbce915d40c1e22e734e254fd3c1128318e77afa989b18641433"}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_20.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A45Z%2F-1%2F%2Fa16eb85a1058f3b530799bdd3f130a8b357778d6d2b7d84119bc3c0c2bb9a3b8"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_20.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A46Z%2F-1%2F%2F878a11993c84136acf4a74c43d2bfc805b9c6f64544ab66744f2428d3a1efe45"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"text","block_content":"The first defining expression has already been interpreted as the amount of information sent less the uncertainty of what was sent.

One would expect, however, that to make this probability of errors approach zero, the redundancy of the encoding must increase indefinitely, and the rate of transmission therefore approach zero.

It is possible to send information at the rate C through the channel with as small a frequency of errors or equivocation as desired by proper encoding.

The second measures the amount received less the part of this which is due to noise. The third is the sum of the two amounts less the joint entropy and therefore in a sense is the number of bits per second common to the two. Thus all three expressions have a certain intuitive significance.\n\nThe capacity C of a noisy channel should be the maximum possible rate of transmission, i.e., the rate when the source is properly matched to the channel. We therefore define the channel capacity by\n\n $$ C=\\operatorname{Max}\\left(H(x)-H_{y}(x)\\right) $$ \n\nwhere the maximum is with respect to all possible information sources used as input to the channel. If the channel is noiseless,  $ H_y(x) = 0 $. The definition is then equivalent to that already given for a noiseless channel since the maximum entropy for the channel is its capacity.\n\n## 13. The Fundamental Theorem for a Discrete Channel with Noise\n\nIt may seem surprising that we should define a definite capacity C for a noisy channel since we can never send certain information in such a case. It is clear, however, that by sending the information in a redundant form the probability of errors can be reduced. For example, by repeating the message many times and by a statistical study of the different received versions of the message the probability of errors could be made very small. One would expect, however, that to make this probability of errors approach zero, the redundancy of the encoding must increase indefinitely, and the rate of transmission therefore approach zero. This is by no means true. If it were, there would not be a very well defined capacity, but only a capacity for a given frequency of errors, or a given equivocation; the capacity going down as the error requirements are made more stringent. Actually the capacity C defined above has a very definite significance. It is possible to send information at the rate C through the channel with as small a frequency of errors or equivocation as desired by proper encoding. This statement is not true for any rate greater than C. If an attempt is made to transmit at a higher rate than C, say  $ C + R_1 $, then there will necessarily be an equivocation equal to or greater than the excess  $ R_1 $. Nature takes payment by requiring just that much uncertainty, so that we are not actually getting any more than C through correctly.\n\nThe situation is indicated in Fig. 9. The rate of information into the channel is plotted horizontally and the equivocation vertically. Any point above the heavy line in the shaded region can be attained and those below cannot. The points on the line cannot in general be attained, but there will usually be two points on the line that can.\n\nThese results are the main justification for the definition of C and will now be proved.\n\n1heorem 11: Let a discrete channel have the capacity C and a discrete source the entropy per second H. If  $ H \\leq C $ there exists a coding system such that the output of the source can be transmitted over the channel with an arbitrarily small frequency of errors (or an arbitrarily small equivocation). If  $ H > C $ it is possible to encode the source so that the equivocation is less than  $ H - C + \\epsilon $ where  $ \\epsilon $ is arbitrarily small. There is no method of encoding which gives an equivocation less than  $ H - C $.\n\nThe method of proving the first part of this theorem is not by exhibiting a coding method having the desired properties, but by showing that such a code must exist in a certain group of codes.

In other words the alteration will not in general bring it closer to another reasonable signal than the original. This is accomplished at the cost of a certain amount of redundancy in the coding. The redundancy must be introduced in the proper way to combat the particular noise structure involved. However, any redundancy in the source will usually help if it is utilized at the receiving point. In particular, if the source already has a certain redundancy and no attempt is made to eliminate it in matching to the channel, this redundancy will help combat noise. For example, in a noiseless telegraph channel one could save about 50% in time by proper encoding of the messages. This is not done and most of the redundancy of English remains in the channel symbols. This has the advantage, however, of allowing considerable noise in the channel. A sizable fraction of the letters can be received incorrectly and still reconstructed by the context.

ways (using, however, only the high probability group of inputs as determined by the source  $ S_0 $) and average the frequency of errors for this large class of possible coding systems. This is the same as calculating the frequency of errors for a random association of the messages and channel inputs of duration  $ T $. Suppose a particular output  $ y_1 $ is observed. What is the probability of more than one message in the set of possible causes of  $ y_1 $? There are  $ 2^{TR} $ messages distributed at random in  $ 2^{TH(x)} $ points. The probability of a particular point being a message is thus\n\n $$ 2^{T(R-H(x))}. $$ \n\nThe probability that none of the points in the fan is a message (apart from the actual originating message) is\n\n $$ P=\\left[1-2^{T(R-H(x))}\\right]^{2^{T H_{\\mathbf{y}}(x)}}. $$ \n\nNow  $  R < H(x) - H_y(x)  $ so  $  R - H(x) = -H_y(x) - \\eta  $ with  $ \\eta $ positive. Consequently\n\n $$ P=\\left[1-2^{-T H_{y}(x)-T\\eta}\\right]^{2^{T H_{y}(x)}} $$ \n\napproaches (as  $ T \\rightarrow \\infty $)\n\n $$ 1-2^{-T\\eta}. $$ \n\nHence the probability of an error approaches zero and the first part of the theorem is proved.\n\nThe second part of the theorem is easily shown by noting that we could merely send C bits per second from the source, completely neglecting the remainder of the information generated. At the receiver the neglected part gives an equivocation  $ H(x) - C $ and the part transmitted need only add  $ \\epsilon $. This limit can also be attained in many other ways, as will be shown when we consider the continuous case.\n\nThe last statement of the theorem is a simple consequence of our definition of $C$. Suppose we can encode a source with $H(x) = C + a$ in such a way as to obtain an equivocation $H_y(x) = a - \\epsilon$ with $\\epsilon$ positive. Then $R = H(x) = C + a$ and\n\n $$ H(x)-H_{y}(x)=C+\\epsilon $$ \n\nwith  $ \\epsilon $ positive. This contradicts the definition of C as the maximum of  $ H(x) - H_y(x) $.\n\nActually more has been proved than was stated in the theorem. If the average of a set of numbers is within  $ \\epsilon $ of their maximum, a fraction of at most  $ \\sqrt{\\epsilon} $ can be more than  $ \\sqrt{\\epsilon} $ below the maximum. Since  $ \\epsilon $ is arbitrarily small we can say that almost all the systems are arbitrarily close to the ideal.\n\n## 14. Discussion\n\nThe demonstration of Theorem 11, while not a pure existence proof, has some of the deficiencies of such proofs. An attempt to obtain a good approximation to ideal coding by following the method of the proof is generally impractical. In fact, apart from some rather trivial cases and certain limiting situations, no explicit description of a series of approximation to the ideal has been found. Probably this is no accident but is related to the difficulty of giving an explicit construction for a good approximation to a random sequence.\n\nAn approximation to the ideal would have the property that if the signal is altered in a reasonable way by the noise, the original can still be recovered. In other words the alteration will not in general bring it closer to another reasonable signal than the original. This is accomplished at the cost of a certain amount of redundancy in the coding. The redundancy must be introduced in the proper way to combat the particular noise structure involved. However, any redundancy in the source will usually help if it is utilized at the receiving point. In particular, if the source already has a certain redundancy and no attempt is made to eliminate it in matching to the channel, this redundancy will help combat noise. For example, in a noiseless telegraph channel one could save about 50% in time by proper encoding of the messages. This is not done and most of the redundancy of English remains in the channel symbols. This has the advantage, however, of allowing considerable noise in the channel. A sizable fraction of the letters can be received incorrectly and still reconstructed by the context. In fact this is probably not a bad approximation to the ideal in many cases, since the statistical structure of English is rather involved and the reasonable English sequences are not too far (in the sense required for the theorem) from a random selection.","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_23.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A48Z%2F-1%2F%2Fee106bcc6f827c570726af8b84f4fc71307ca0a1bd4fac2c350667368153d52d"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_23.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A48Z%2F-1%2F%2F967ca8e00417c127e384f6f50b7c298dd69bda3fdd071e33e5b1e34096378887"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"text","block_content":"As in the noiseless case a delay is generally required to approach the ideal encoding.

in the noiseless case a delay is generally required to approach the ideal encoding. It now has the additional function of allowing a large sample of noise to affect the signal before any judgment is made at the receiving point as to the original message. Increasing the sample size always sharpens the possible statistical assertions.\n\nThe content of Theorem 11 and its proof can be formulated in a somewhat different way which exhibits the connection with the noiseless case more clearly. Consider the possible signals of duration T and suppose a subset of them is selected to be used. Let those in the subset all be used with equal probability, and suppose the receiver is constructed to select, as the original signal, the most probable cause from the subset, when a perturbed signal is received. We define  $ N(T, q) $ to be the maximum number of signals we can choose for the subset such that the probability of an incorrect interpretation is less than or equal to q.\n\nTheorem 12:  $ \\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\log N(T,q)}{T}=C $, where C is the channel capacity, provided that q does not equal 0 or 1.\n\nIn other words, no matter how we set out limits of reliability, we can distinguish reliably in time T enough messages to correspond to about CT bits, when T is sufficiently large. Theorem 12 can be compared with the definition of the capacity of a noiseless channel given in Section 1.\n\n## 15. EXAMPLE OF A DISCRETE CHANNEL AND ITS CAPACITY\n\nA simple example of a discrete channel is indicated in Fig. 11. There are three possible symbols. The first is never affected by noise. The second and third each have probability $p$ of coming through undisturbed, and $q$ of being changed into the other of the pair. We have (letting $\\alpha = -[p\\log p + q\\log q]$ and $P$ and $Q$ be the\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"imgs/img_in_image_box_431_777_774_923.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"28%\" /></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig. 11—Example of a discrete channel.</div>\n\n\nprobabilities of using the first and second symbols)\n\n $$ H(x)=-P\\log P-2Q\\log Q $$ \n\n $$ H_{y}(x)=2Q\\alpha. $$ \n\nWe wish to choose P and Q in such a way as to maximize  $ H(x) - H_y(x) $, subject to the constraint  $ P + 2Q = 1 $.

$$ P=\\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+2}\\quad Q=\\frac{1}{\\beta+2}. $$ \n\nThe channel capacity is then\n\n $$ C=\\log\\frac{\\beta+2}{\\beta}. $$ \n\nNote how this checks the obvious values in the cases $p=1$ and $p=\\frac{1}{2}$. In the first, $\\beta=1$ and $C=\\log 3$, which is correct since the channel is then noiseless with three possible symbols. If $p=\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\beta=2$ and $C=\\log 2$. Here the second and third symbols cannot be distinguished at all and act together like one symbol. The first symbol is used with probability $P=\\frac{1}{2}$ and the second and third together with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. This may be distributed between them in any desired way and still achieve the maximum capacity.\n\nFor intermediate values of p the channel capacity will lie between  $ \\log 2 $ and  $ \\log 3 $. The distinction between the second and third symbols conveys some information but not as much as in the noiseless case. The first symbol is used somewhat more frequently than the other two because of its freedom from noise.\n\n## 16. THE CHANNEL CAPACITY IN CERTAIN SPECIAL CASES\n\nIf the noise affects successive channel symbols independently it can be described by a set of transition probabilities  $ p_{ij} $. This is the probability, if symbol i is sent, that j will be received. The maximum channel rate is then given by the maximum of\n\n $$ -\\sum_{i,j}P_{i}p_{ij}\\log\\sum_{i}P_{i}p_{ij}+\\sum_{i,j}P_{i}p_{ij}\\log p_{ij} $$ \n\nwhere we vary the  $ P_i $ subject to  $ \\sum P_i = 1 $. This leads by the method of Lagrange to the equations,\n\n $$ \\sum_{j}p_{s j}\\log\\frac{p_{s j}}{\\sum_{i}P_{i}p_{i j}}=\\mu\\qquad s=1,2,\\ldots. $$ \n\nMultiplying by $P_s$ and summing on $s$ shows that $\\mu = C$. Let the inverse of $p_{sj}$ (if it exists) be $h_{st}$ so that $\\sum_s h_{st} p_{sj} = \\delta_{tj}$. Then:\n\n $$ \\sum_{s,j}h_{s t}p_{s j}\\log p_{s j}-\\log\\sum_{i}P_{i}p_{i t}=C\\sum_{s}h_{s t}. $$ \n\nHence:\n\n $$ \\sum_{i}P_{i}p_{it}=\\exp\\Big[-C\\sum_{s}h_{st}+\\sum_{s,j}h_{st}p_{sj}\\log p_{sj}\\Big] $$ \n\nor,\n\n $$ P_{i}=\\sum_{t}h_{it}\\exp\\left[-C\\sum_{s}h_{st}+\\sum_{s,j}h_{st}p_{sj}\\log p_{sj}\\right]. $$ \n\nThis is the system of equations for determining the maximizing values of  $ P_i $, with  $ C $ to be determined so that  $ \\sum P_i = 1 $. When this is done  $ C $ will be the channel capacity, and the  $ P_i $ the proper probabilities for the channel symbols to achieve this capacity.\n\nIf each input symbol has the same set of probabilities on the lines emerging from it, and the same is true of each output symbol, the capacity can be easily calculated. Examples are shown in Fig. 12.

Thus the expression holds in general. The choice of coefficient K is a matter of convenience and amounts to the choice of a unit of measure.\n\n#### APPENDIX 3\n\n### THEOREMS ON ERGODIC SOURCES\n\nIf it is possible to go from any state with $P > 0$ to any other along a path of probability $p > 0$, the system is ergodic and the strong law of large numbers can be applied. Thus the number of times a given path $p_{ij}$ in the network is traversed in a long sequence of length $N$ is about proportional to the probability of being at $i$, say $P_i$, and then choosing this path, $P_{i}p_{ij}N$. If $N$ is large enough the probability of percentage error $\\pm \\delta$ in this is less than $\\epsilon$ so that for all but a set of small probability the actual numbers lie within the limits\n\n $$ (P_{i}p_{i j}\\pm\\delta)N. $$ \n\nHence nearly all sequences have a probability p given by\n\n $$ p=\\prod p_{ij}^{(P_{i}p_{ij}\\pm\\delta)N} $$ ","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_28.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A51Z%2F-1%2F%2F00491ac3b49fce86d3a12a97f73366148f8d9bc52ef548d2905e42eef1f1c1a7"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_28.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A51Z%2F-1%2F%2Fe9de3f435f00698b5e30196c68bb39db0668b1168fd580210d5764634df81f22"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"text","block_content":"and  $ \\frac{\\log p}{N} $ is limited by","block_bbox":[179,178,370,224],"block_id":0,"block_order":1,"group_id":0,"block_polygon_points":[[179.0,178.0],[370.0,178.0],[370.0,224.0],[179.0,224.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ \\frac{\\log p}{N}=\\sum(P_{i}p_{ij}\\pm\\delta)\\log p_{ij} $$ ","block_bbox":[494,222,728,266],"block_id":1,"block_order":2,"group_id":1,"block_polygon_points":[[494.0,222.0],[728.0,222.0],[728.0,266.0],[494.0,266.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"or","block_bbox":[179,273,205,291],"block_id":2,"block_order":3,"group_id":2,"block_polygon_points":[[179.0,273.0],[204.0,273.0],[204.0,290.0],[179.0,290.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ \\left|\\frac{\\log p}{N}-\\sum P_{i}p_{i j}\\log p_{i j}\\right|<\\eta. $$ ","block_bbox":[495,286,728,332],"block_id":3,"block_order":4,"group_id":3,"block_polygon_points":[[495.0,286.0],[728.0,286.0],[728.0,332.0],[495.0,332.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"This proves Theorem 3.","block_bbox":[180,339,374,362],"block_id":4,"block_order":5,"group_id":4,"block_polygon_points":[[180.0,339.0],[374.0,339.0],[374.0,362.0],[180.0,362.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"Theorem 4 follows immediately from this on calculating upper and lower bounds for  $ n(q) $ based on the possible range of values of p in Theorem 3.","block_bbox":[178,363,1041,413],"block_id":5,"block_order":6,"group_id":5,"block_polygon_points":[[178.0,363.0],[1041.0,363.0],[1041.0,413.0],[178.0,413.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"In the mixed (not ergodic) case if","block_bbox":[208,412,485,435],"block_id":6,"block_order":7,"group_id":6,"block_polygon_points":[[208.0,412.0],[485.0,412.0],[485.0,435.0],[208.0,435.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ L=\\sum p_{i}L_{i} $$ ","block_bbox":[561,432,660,462],"block_id":7,"block_order":8,"group_id":7,"block_polygon_points":[[561.0,432.0],[660.0,432.0],[660.0,462.0],[561.0,462.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"and the entropies of the components are  $ H_1 \\geq H_2 \\geq \\cdots \\geq H_n $ we have the","block_bbox":[178,471,770,495],"block_id":8,"block_order":9,"group_id":8,"block_polygon_points":[[178.0,471.0],[770.0,471.0],[770.0,495.0],[178.0,495.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"Theorem:  $ \\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\log n(q)}{N}=\\varphi(q) $ is a decreasing step function,","block_bbox":[209,500,693,535],"block_id":9,"block_order":10,"group_id":9,"block_polygon_points":[[209.0,500.0],[693.0,500.0],[693.0,535.0],[209.0,535.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ \\varphi(q)=H_{s}\\quad in the interval\\quad\\sum_{1}^{s-1}\\alpha_{i}<q<\\sum_{1}^{s}\\alpha_{i}. $$ ","block_bbox":[413,559,806,616],"block_id":10,"block_order":11,"group_id":10,"block_polygon_points":[[413.0,559.0],[806.0,559.0],[806.0,616.0],[413.0,616.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"To prove Theorems 5 and 6 first note that  $ F_N $ is monotonic decreasing because increasing  $ N $ adds a subscript to a conditional entropy.

Let  $ \\ell_{ij}^{(s)} $ be the lengths of the various symbols that can occur in passing from state i to state j. What distribution of probabilities  $ P_i $ for the different states and  $ p_{ij}^{(s)} $ for choosing symbol s in state i and going to state j maximizes the rate of generating information under these constraints? The constraints define a discrete channel and the maximum rate must be less than or equal to the capacity C of this channel, since if all blocks of large length were equally likely, this rate would result, and if possible this would be best. We will show that this rate can be achieved by proper choice of the  $ P_i $ and  $ p_{ii}^{(s)} $.\n\nThe rate in question is\n\n $$ \\frac{-\\sum P_{i}p_{ij}^{(s)}\\log p_{ij}^{(s)}}{\\sum P_{i}p_{ij}^{(s)}\\ell_{ij}^{(s)}}=\\frac{N}{M}. $$ \n\nLet  $ \\ell_{ij} = \\sum_s \\ell_{ij}^{(s)} $. Evidently for a maximum  $ p_{ij}^{(s)} = k \\exp \\ell_{ij}^{(s)} $. The constraints on maximization are  $ \\sum P_i = 1 $,  $ \\sum_j p_{ij} = 1 $,  $ \\sum P_i(p_{ij} - \\delta_{ij}) = 0 $. Hence we maximize\n\n $$ \\begin{align*}U&=\\frac{-\\sum P_{i}p_{ij}\\log p_{ij}}{\\sum

PART III: MATHEMATICAL PRELIMINARIES\n\nIn this final installment of the paper we consider the case where the signals or the messages or both are continuously variable, in contrast with the discrete nature assumed heretofore. To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases.\n\nWe will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results with the greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, since this would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and would obscure the main thread of the analysis. A preliminary study, however, indicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic and rigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases and many others. The occasional liberties taken with limiting processes in the present analysis can be justified in all cases of practical interest.\n\n## 18. SETS AND ENSEMBLES OF FUNCTIONS\n\nWe shall have to deal in the continuous case with sets of functions and ensembles of functions. A set of functions, as the name implies, is merely a class or collection of functions, generally of one variable, time. It can be specified by giving an explicit representation of the various functions in the set, or implicitly by giving a property which functions in the set possess and others do not. Some examples are:\n\n1. The set of functions:\n\n $$ f_{\\theta}(t)=\\sin(t+\\theta). $$ \n\nEach particular value of  $ \\theta $ determines a particular function in the set.\n\n2. The set of all functions of time containing no frequencies over W cycles per second.\n\n3. The set of all functions limited in band to W and in amplitude to A.\n\n4. The set of all English speech signals as functions of time.\n\nAn ensemble of functions is a set of functions together with a probability measure whereby we may determine the probability of a function in the set having certain properties. $ ^{1} $ For example with the set,\n\n $$ f_{\\theta}(t)=\\sin(t+\\theta), $$ \n\nwe may give a probability distribution for  $ \\theta $,  $ P(\\theta) $. The set then becomes an ensemble.\n\nSome further examples of ensembles of functions are:\n\n1. A finite set of functions  $ f_{k}(t) $ ( $ k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n $) with the probability of  $ f_{k} $ being  $ p_{k} $.\n\n2. A finite dimensional family of functions\n\n $$ f(\\alpha_{1},\\alpha_{2},\\ldots,\\alpha_{n};t) $$ \n\nwith a probability distribution on the parameters  $ \\alpha_{i} $:\n\n $$ p(\\alpha_{1},\\ldots,\\alpha_{n}). $$ \n\nFor example we could consider the ensemble defined by\n\n $$ f(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n},\\theta_{1},\\ldots,\\theta_{n};t)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}\\sin i(\\omega t+\\theta_{i}) $$ \n\nwith the amplitudes  $ a_i $ distributed normally and independently, and the phases  $ \\theta_i $ distributed uniformly (from 0 to  $ 2\\pi $) and independently.\n\n $ ^{1} $In mathematical terminology the functions belong to a measure space whose total measure is unity.","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_31.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A53Z%2F-1%2F%2Fe586f6237dbaa34414194a9e5e67aa43a96cec0eb7f90b5a2a8f087c562cc924"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_31.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A53Z%2F-1%2F%2F819df6e461c7c5c4861a1ea7d730ae7ea28f2dcf1e15149151d2e441de587b4f"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"text","block_content":"3.

ENTROPY OF A CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTION\n\nThe entropy of a discrete set of probabilities  $ p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{n} $ has been defined as:\n\n $$ H=-\\sum p_{i}\\log p_{i}. $$ \n\nIn an analogous manner we define the entropy of a continuous distribution with the density distribution function  $ p(x) $ by:\n\n $$ H=-\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}p(x)\\log p(x)dx. $$ \n\nWith an $n$ dimensional distribution $p(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n})$ we have\n\n $$ H=-\\int\\cdots\\int p(x_{1},\\cdots,x_{n})\\log p(x_{1},\\cdots,x_{n})dx_{1}\\cdots dx_{n}. $$ \n\nIf we have two arguments x and y (which may themselves be multidimensional) the joint and conditional entropies of  $ p(x,y) $ are given by\n\n $$ H(x,y)=-\\iint p(x,y)\\log p(x,y)dx dy $$ \n\nand\n\n $$ H_{x}(y)=-\\iint p(x,y)\\log\\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)}dxdy $$ \n\n $$ H_{y}(x)=-\\iint p(x,y)\\log\\frac{p(x,y)}{p(y)}dxdy $$ \n\nwhere\n\n $$ p(x)=\\int p(x,y)dy $$ \n\n $$ p(y)=\\int p(x,y)dx. $$ \n\nThe entropies of continuous distributions have most (but not all) of the properties of the discrete case. In particular we have the following:\n\n1. If $x$ is limited to a certain volume $v$ in its space, then $H(x)$ is a maximum and equal to $\\log v$ when $p(x)$ is constant $(1/v)$ in the volume.","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_34.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A55Z%2F-1%2F%2Fa699650629559af1108702e89586dab18820ed8616d671eefdf387e774bda640"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_34.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A55Z%2F-1%2F%2F6ca71ba8e58baba9656a874975f3fb42de2c1f836c27639c84cbf317eb2b7c4e"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"text","block_content":"2.

the new entropy is the old entropy less the expected logarithm of the Jacobian. In the continuous case the entropy can be considered a measure of randomness relative to an assumed standard, namely the coordinate system chosen with each small volume element  $ dx_1 \\cdots dx_n $ given equal weight. When we change the coordinate system the entropy in the new system measures the randomness when equal volume elements  $ dy_1 \\cdots dy_n $ in the new system are given equal weight.\n\nIn spite of this dependence on the coordinate system the entropy concept is as important in the continuous case as the discrete case. This is due to the fact that the derived concepts of information rate and channel capacity depend on the difference of two entropies and this difference does not depend on the coordinate frame, each of the two terms being changed by the same amount.\n\nThe entropy of a continuous distribution can be negative. The scale of measurements sets an arbitrary zero corresponding to a uniform distribution over a unit volume. A distribution which is more confined than this has less entropy and will be negative. The rates and capacities will, however, always be non-negative.\n\n9.

The Jacobian of the transformation is (for n sine and n cosine components)\n\n $$ J=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}|Y(f_{i})|^{2} $$ \n\nwhere the  $ f_{i} $ are equally spaced through the band W. This becomes in the limit\n\n $$ \\exp\\frac{1}{W}\\int_{W}\\log\\left|Y(f)\\right|^{2}df. $$ \n\nSince J is constant its average value is the same quantity and applying the theorem on the change of entropy with a change of coordinates, the result follows. We may also phrase it in terms of the entropy power. Thus if the entropy power of the first ensemble is  $ N_{1} $ that of the second is\n\n $$ N_{1}\\exp\\frac{1}{W}\\int_{W}\\log\\left|Y(f)\\right|^{2}df. $$ ","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_38.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A57Z%2F-1%2F%2Fa7115428f2a8090e999a67d0e8bbd53f2a528361619aed087db491300ff52b5c"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_38.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A57Z%2F-1%2F%2F25a4cb7b330f62a9bc12e0bd4c651e84435bbd26472c1cf6310a7266be2620e0"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"figure_title","block_content":"<div style=\"text-align: center;\">TABLE I</div>\n","block_bbox":[574,176,648,196],"block_id":0,"group_id":0,"block_polygon_points":[[574.0,176.0],[647.0,176.0],[647.0,195.0],[574.0,195.0]]},{"block_label":"table","block_content":"\n<table border=1 style='margin: auto; word-wrap: break-word;'><tr><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>GAIN</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>ENTROPY POWER FACTOR</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>ENTROPY POWER GAIN IN DECIBELS</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>IMPULSE RESPONSE</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'><img src=\"imgs/img_in_image_box_332_280_551_420.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"\" /></td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>$ \\frac{1}{e^{2}} $</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>-8.69</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>$ \\frac{\\sin^{2}(t/2)}{t^{2}/2} $</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'><img src=\"imgs/img_in_image_box_323_431_552_567.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"\" /></td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>$ \\left(\\frac{2}{e}\\right)^{4} $</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>-5.33</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>$ 2\\left[\\frac{\\sin t}{t^{3}} - \\frac{\\cos t}{t^{2}}\\right] $</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'><img src=\"imgs/img_in_image_box_321_577_553_712.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"\" /></td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>0.411</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>-3.87</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>$ 6\\left[\\frac{\\cos t - 1}{t^{4}} - \\frac{\\cos t}{2t^{2}} + \\frac{\\sin t}{t^{3}}\\right] $</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>$ \\sqrt{1 - \\omega^{2}} \\rightarrow $</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>$ \\left(\\frac{2}{e}\\right)^{2} $</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>-2.67</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>$ \\frac{\\pi}{2} J_{1}(t) $</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>0</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>$ \\omega $</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>1</td><td style='text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;'>$ \\frac{1}{\\omega^{2}} \\left[\\cos(1 - \\alpha)t - \\cos t\\right] $</td></tr></table>","block_bbox":[303,225,918,1010],"block_id":1,"group_id":1,"block_polygon_points":[[303.0,225.0],[918.0,225.0],[918.0,1010.0],[303.0,1010.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"The final entropy power is the initial entropy power multiplied by the geometric mean gain of the filter.

corresponds to adding the noises or signals represented by the original ensembles of functions.\n\nThe following result is derived in Appendix 6.\n\nTheorem 15: Let the average power of two ensembles be  $ N_1 $ and  $ N_2 $ and let their entropy powers be  $ \\overline{N}_1 $ and  $ \\overline{N}_2 $. Then the entropy power of the sum,  $ \\overline{N}_3 $, is bounded by\n\n $$ \\overline{{N}}_{1}+\\overline{{N}}_{2}\\leq\\overline{{N}}_{3}\\leq N_{1}+N_{2}. $$ \n\nWhite Gaussian noise has the peculiar property that it can absorb any other noise or signal ensemble which may be added to it with a resultant entropy power approximately equal to the sum of the white noise power and the signal power (measured from the average signal value, which is normally zero), provided the signal power is small, in a certain sense, compared to noise.\n\nConsider the function space associated with these ensembles having $n$ dimensions. The white noise corresponds to the spherical Gaussian distribution in this space. The signal ensemble corresponds to another probability distribution, not necessarily Gaussian or spherical. Let the second moments of this distribution about its center of gravity be $a_{ij}$. That is, if $p(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)$ is the density distribution function\n\n $$ a_{ij}=\\int\\cdots\\int p(x_{i}-\\alpha_{i})(x_{j}-\\alpha_{j})dx_{1}\\cdots dx_{n} $$ \n\nwhere the  $ \\alpha_{i} $ are the coordinates of the center of gravity. Now  $ a_{ij} $ is a positive definite quadratic form, and we can rotate our coordinate system to align it with the principal directions of this form.  $ a_{ij} $ is then reduced to diagonal form  $ b_{ii} $. We require that each  $ b_{ii} $ be small compared to N, the squared radius of the spherical distribution.\n\nIn this case the convolution of the noise and signal produce approximately a Gaussian distribution whose corresponding quadratic form is\n\n $$ N+b_{ii}. $$ \n\nThe entropy power of this distribution is\n\n $$ \\left[\\prod(N+b_{ii})\\right]^{1/n} $$ \n\nor approximately\n\n $$ \\begin{align*}=\\left[(N)^{n}+\\sum b_{ii}(N)^{n-1}\\right]^{1/n}\\\\ \\doteq N+\\frac{1}{n}\\sum b_{ii}.\\end{align*} $$ \n\nThe last term is the signal power, while the first is the noise power.\n\n### PART IV: THE CONTINUOUS CHANNEL\n\n## 24. THE CAPACITY OF A CONTINUOUS CHANNEL\n\nIn a continuous channel the input or transmitted signals will be continuous functions of time  $ f(t) $ belonging to a certain set, and the output or received signals will be perturbed versions of these. We will consider only the case where both transmitted and received signals are limited to a certain band W. They can then be specified, for a time T, by 2TW numbers, and their statistical structure by finite dimensional distribution functions. Thus the statistics of the transmitted signal will be determined by\n\n $$ P(x_{1},\\cdots,x_{n})=P(x) $$ ","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_40.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A59Z%2F-1%2F%2Fcbf7d1f1f37b047ef43292161687817644676c1e6b07f2634de300c6a22b52b2"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_40.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A59Z%2F-1%2F%2Fe8bfa058089264226e110f1d059927ac67c045dc2782d1b0bf85d89a3e7a626a"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"text","block_content":"and those of the noise by the conditional probability distribution","block_bbox":[179,183,700,207],"block_id":0,"block_order":1,"group_id":0,"block_polygon_points":[[179.0,183.0],[700.0,183.0],[700.0,207.0],[179.0,207.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ P_{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}}(y_{1},\\ldots,y_{n})=P_{x}(y). $$ ","block_bbox":[495,223,723,250],"block_id":1,"block_order":2,"group_id":1,"block_polygon_points":[[495.0,223.0],[723.0,223.0],[723.0,250.0],[495.0,250.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"The rate of transmission of information for a continuous channel is defined in a way analogous to that for a discrete channel, namely","block_bbox":[179,265,1042,313],"block_id":2,"block_order":3,"group_id":2,"block_polygon_points":[[179.0,265.0],[1042.0,265.0],[1042.0,313.0],[179.0,313.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ R=H(x)-H_{y}(x) $$ ","block_bbox":[534,312,685,337],"block_id":3,"block_order":4,"group_id":3,"block_polygon_points":[[534,312],[534,330],[547,336],[558,336],[571,336],[684,336],[684,312]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"where $H(x)$ is the entropy of the input and $H_y(x)$ the equivocation.

those of the noise by the conditional probability distribution\n\n $$ P_{x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}}(y_{1},\\ldots,y_{n})=P_{x}(y). $$ \n\nThe rate of transmission of information for a continuous channel is defined in a way analogous to that for a discrete channel, namely\n\n $$ R=H(x)-H_{y}(x) $$ \n\nwhere $H(x)$ is the entropy of the input and $H_y(x)$ the equivocation. The channel capacity $C$ is defined as the maximum of $R$ when we vary the input over all possible ensembles. This means that in a finite dimensional approximation we must vary $P(x) = P(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)$ and maximize\n\n $$ -\\int P(x)\\log P(x)dx+\\iint P(x,y)\\log\\frac{P(x,y)}{P(y)}dx dy. $$ \n\nThis can be written\n\n $$ \\iint P(x,y)\\log\\frac{P(x,y)}{P(x)P(y)}dxdy $$ \n\nusing the fact that  $ \\iint P(x,y)\\log P(x)\\,dx\\,dy = \\int P(x)\\log P(x)\\,dx $. The channel capacity is thus expressed as follows:\n\n $$ C=\\operatorname{L i m}_{T\\to\\infty}\\operatorname{M a x}_{P(x)}\\frac{1}{T}\\iint P(x,y)\\log\\frac{P(x,y)}{P(x)P(y)}d x d y. $$ \n\nIt is obvious in this form that $R$ and $C$ are independent of the coordinate system since the numerator and denominator in $\\log \\frac{P(x,y)}{P(x)P(y)}$ will be multiplied by the same factors when $x$ and $y$ are transformed in any one-to-one way. This integral expression for $C$ is more general than $H(x) - H_y(x)$. Properly interpreted (see Appendix 7) it will always exist while $H(x) - H_y(x)$ may assume an indeterminate form $\\infty - \\infty$ in some cases. This occurs, for example, if $x$ is limited to a surface of fewer dimensions than $n$ in its $n$ dimensional approximation.\n\nIf the logarithmic base used in computing  $ H(x) $ and  $ H_y(x) $ is two then C is the maximum number of binary digits that can be sent per second over the channel with arbitrarily small equivocation, just as in the discrete case. This can be seen physically by dividing the space of signals into a large number of small cells, sufficiently small so that the probability density  $ P_x(y) $ of signal x being perturbed to point y is substantially constant over a cell (either of x or y). If the cells are considered as distinct points the situation is essentially the same as a discrete channel and the proofs used there will apply. But it is clear physically that this quantizing of the volume into individual points cannot in any practical situation alter the final answer significantly, provided the regions are sufficiently small. Thus the capacity will be the limit of the capacities for the discrete subdivisions and this is just the continuous capacity defined above.\n\nOn the mathematical side it can be shown first (see Appendix 7) that if u is the message, x is the signal, y is the received signal (perturbed by noise) and v is the recovered message then\n\n $$ H(x)-H_{y}(x)\\geq H(u)-H_{v}(u) $$ \n\nregardless of what operations are performed on $u$ to obtain $x$ or on $y$ to obtain $v$. Thus no matter how we encode the binary digits to obtain the signal, or how we decode the received signal to recover the message, the discrete rate for the binary digits does not exceed the channel capacity we have defined. On the other hand, it is possible under very general conditions to find a coding system for transmitting binary digits at the rate $C$ with as small an equivocation or frequency of errors as desired. This is true, for example, if, when we take a finite dimensional approximating space for the signal functions, $P(x,y)$ is continuous in both $x$ and $y$ except at a set of points of probability zero.\n\nAn important special case occurs when the noise is added to the signal and is independent of it (in the probability sense). Then  $ P_{x}(y) $ is a function only of the difference  $ n = (y - x) $,\n\n $$ P_{x}(y)=Q(y-x) $$ ","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_41.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A59Z%2F-1%2F%2F2c427c691e04969ff127c2fcf58284ab42b1027916a1273a33fdef3154779c91"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_41.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A05%3A59Z%2F-1%2F%2F2b0c389a534e1d9001dedf381087b77a3ae2135e7bed3eb4df6cb60a705926ee"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"text","block_content":"and we can assign a definite entropy to the noise (independent of the statistics of the signal), namely the entropy of the distribution  $ Q(n) $.

$ M = 2^{s} $ samples of white noise be constructed each of duration T. These are assigned binary numbers from 0 to M - 1. At the transmitter the message sequences are broken up into groups of s and for each group the corresponding noise sample is transmitted as the signal. At the receiver the M samples are known and the actual received signal (perturbed by noise) is compared with each of them. The sample which has the least R.M.S. discrepancy from the received signal is chosen as the transmitted signal and the corresponding binary number reconstructed. This process amounts to choosing the most probable (a posteriori) signal. The number M of noise samples used will depend on the tolerable frequency  $ \\epsilon $ of errors, but for almost all selections of samples we have\n\n $$ \\operatorname*{L i m}_{\\epsilon\\to0}\\operatorname*{L i m}_{T\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\operatorname{l o g}M(\\epsilon,T)}{T}=W\\operatorname{l o g}\\frac{P+N}{N}, $$ \n\nso that no matter how small  $ \\epsilon $ is chosen, we can, by taking  $ T $ sufficiently large, transmit as near as we wish to  $ TW \\log \\frac{P + N}{N} $ binary digits in the time  $ T $.\n\nFormulas similar to  $ C = W \\log \\frac{I + N}{N} $ for the white noise case have been developed independently by several other writers, although with somewhat different interpretations.

These bounds are sufficiently close together in most practical cases to furnish a satisfactory solution to the problem.\n\nTheorem 18: The capacity of a channel of band W perturbed by an arbitrary noise is bounded by the inequalities\n\n $$ W\\log\\frac{P+N_{1}}{N_{1}}\\leq C\\leq W\\log\\frac{P+N}{N_{1}} $$ \n\nwhere\n\n $$ P=a v e r a g e t r a n s m i t t e r p o w e r $$ \n\n $$ N=a v e r a g e n o i s e p o w e r $$ \n\n $$ N_{1}=entropy power of the noise. $$ \n\nHere again the average power of the perturbed signals will be  $ P + N $.

general, a channel of infinite capacity (in bits per second). Since, ordinarily, channels have a certain amount of noise, and therefore a finite capacity, exact transmission is impossible.\n\nThis, however, evades the real issue. Practically, we are not interested in exact transmission when we have a continuous source, but only in transmission to within a certain tolerance. The question is, can we assign a definite rate to a continuous source when we require only a certain fidelity of recovery, measured in a suitable way. Of course, as the fidelity requirements are increased the rate will increase. It will be shown that we can, in very general cases, define such a rate, having the property that it is possible, by properly encoding the information, to transmit it over a channel whose capacity is equal to the rate in question, and satisfy the fidelity requirements. A channel of smaller capacity is insufficient.\n\nIt is first necessary to give a general mathematical formulation of the idea of fidelity of transmission. Consider the set of messages of a long duration, say T seconds. The source is described by giving the probability density, in the associated space, that the source will select the message in question  $ P(x) $. A given communication system is described (from the external point of view) by giving the conditional probability  $ P_x(y) $ that if message x is produced by the source the recovered message at the receiving point will be y. The system as a whole (including source and transmission system) is described by the probability function  $ P(x,y) $ of having message x and final output y. If this function is known, the complete characteristics of the system from the point of view of fidelity are known. Any evaluation of fidelity must correspond mathematically to an operation applied to  $ P(x,y) $. This operation must at least have the properties of a simple ordering of systems; i.e., it must be possible to say of two systems represented by  $ P_1(x,y) $ and  $ P_2(x,y) $ that, according to our fidelity criterion, either (1) the first has higher fidelity, (2) the second has higher fidelity, or (3) they have equal fidelity. This means that a criterion of fidelity can be represented by a numerically valued function:\n\n $$ \\nu\\left(P(x,y)\\right) $$ \n\nwhose argument ranges over possible probability functions  $ P(x,y) $.\n\nWe will now show that under very general and reasonable assumptions the function  $ \\nu(P(x,y)) $ can be written in a seemingly much more specialized form, namely as an average of a function  $ \\rho(x,y) $ over the set of possible values of x and y:\n\n $$ \\nu\\big(P(x,y)\\big)=\\iint P(x,y)\\rho(x,y)d x d y. $$ \n\nTo obtain this we need only assume (1) that the source and system are ergodic so that a very long sample will be, with probability nearly 1, typical of the ensemble, and (2) that the evaluation is “reasonable” in the sense that it is possible, by observing a typical input and output  $ x_1 $ and  $ y_1 $, to form a tentative evaluation on the basis of these samples; and if these samples are increased in duration the tentative evaluation will, with probability 1, approach the exact evaluation based on a full knowledge of  $ P(x,y) $. Let the tentative evaluation be  $ \\rho(x,y) $. Then the function  $ \\rho(x,y) $ approaches (as  $ T \\to \\infty $) a constant for almost all  $ (x,y) $ which are in the high probability region corresponding to the system:\n\n $$ \\rho(x,y)\\rightarrow\\nu\\big(P(x,y)\\big) $$ \n\nand we may also write\n\n $$ \\rho(x,y)\\rightarrow\\iint P(x,y)\\rho(x,y)dxdy $$ \n\nsince\n\n $$ \\iint P(x,y)d x d y=1. $$ \n\nThis establishes the desired result.\n\nThe function  $ \\rho(x,y) $ has the general nature of a “distance” between x and  $ y $. It measures how undesirable it is (according to our fidelity criterion) to receive y when x is transmitted. The general result given above can be restated as follows: Any reasonable evaluation can be represented as an average of a distance function over the set of messages and recovered messages x and y weighted according to the probability  $ P(x,y) $ of getting the pair in question, provided the duration T of the messages be taken sufficiently large.\n\nThe following are simple examples of evaluation functions:","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_47.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A06%3A03Z%2F-1%2F%2F79d292ab0aff3c5775037171d94ca9f496504e1147717df0810c0afbcbabd5d9"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_47.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A06%3A03Z%2F-1%2F%2F9b3341afcb1ea476d2d0838bebaa717ba903d0d74537e23a03db2a41c01e2a69"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"paragraph_title","block_content":"## 1.

fidelity. The rate of transmission in bits per second is calculated for each one and we choose that having the least rate. This latter rate is the rate we assign the source for the fidelity in question.\n\nThe justification of this definition lies in the following result:\n\nTheorem 21: If a source has a rate  $ R_1 $ for a valuation  $ v_1 $ it is possible to encode the output of the source and transmit it over a channel of capacity  $ C $ with fidelity as near  $ v_1 $ as desired provided  $ R_1 \\leq C $. This is not possible if  $ R_1 > C $.\n\nThe last statement in the theorem follows immediately from the definition of  $ R_1 $ and previous results. If it were not true we could transmit more than  $ C $ bits per second over a channel of capacity  $ C $. The first part of the theorem is proved by a method analogous to that used for Theorem 11. We may, in the first place, divide the  $ (x, y) $ space into a large number of small cells and represent the situation as a discrete case. This will not change the evaluation function by more than an arbitrarily small amount (when the cells are very small) because of the continuity assumed for  $ \\rho(x, y) $. Suppose that  $ P_1(x, y) $ is the particular system which minimizes the rate and gives  $ R_1 $. We choose from the high probability  $ y $'s a set at random containing\n\n $$ 2^{(R_{1}+\\epsilon)T} $$ \n\nmembers where  $ \\epsilon \\to 0 $ as  $ T \\to \\infty $. With large  $ T $ each chosen point will be connected by a high probability line (as in Fig. 10) to a set of  $ x $'s. A calculation similar to that used in proving Theorem 11 shows that with large  $ T $ almost all  $ x $'s are covered by the fans from the chosen  $ y $ points for almost all choices of the  $ y $'s. The communication system to be used operates as follows: The selected points are assigned binary numbers. When a message  $ x $ is originated it will (with probability approaching  $ 1 $ as  $ T \\to \\infty $) lie within at least one of the fans. The corresponding binary number is transmitted (or one of them chosen arbitrarily if there are several) over the channel by suitable coding means to give a small probability of error. Since  $ R_1 \\leq C $ this is possible. At the receiving point the corresponding  $ y $ is reconstructed and used as the recovered message.\n\nThe evaluation  $ v_{1}^{\\prime} $ for this system can be made arbitrarily close to  $ v_{1} $ by taking T sufficiently large. This is due to the fact that for each long sample of message  $ x(t) $ and recovered message  $ y(t) $ the evaluation approaches  $ v_{1} $ (with probability 1).\n\nIt is interesting to note that, in this system, the noise in the recovered message is actually produced by a kind of general quantizing at the transmitter and not produced by the noise in the channel. It is more or less analogous to the quantizing noise in PCM.\n\n## 29. THE CALCULATION OF RATES\n\nThe definition of the rate is similar in many respects to the definition of channel capacity. In the former\n\n $$ R=\\operatorname{Min}\\iint\\limits_{P_{x}(y)}\\log\\frac{P(x,y)}{P(x)P(y)}dxdy $$ \n\nwith P(x) and v1 = ∫ ∫ P(x,y)ρ(x,y) dx dy fixed. In the latter\n\n $$ C=\\operatorname{Max}\\iint\\limits_{P(x)}\\operatorname{log}\\frac{P(x,y)}{P(x)P(y)}dx dy $$ \n\nwith $P_x(y)$ fixed and possibly one or more other constraints (e.g., an average power limitation) of the form $K = \\iint P(x,y)\\lambda(x,y)\\,dx\\,dy$.\n\nA partial solution of the general maximizing problem for determining the rate of a source can be given. Using Lagrange's method we consider\n\n $$ \\iint\\left[P(x,y)\\log\\frac{P(x,y)}{P(x)P(y)}+\\mu P(x,y)\\rho(x,y)+\\nu(x)P(x,y)\\right]dxdy. $$ ","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_49.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A06%3A04Z%2F-1%2F%2F82c923c86ec3e5feb8396636c9d7ee61fbcc452d5b729931066dc31409a7ca54"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_49.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A06%3A04Z%2F-1%2F%2F2d92bac21de6c97daf79abea10cd995e84415296791220a6a6030e7001bcf7ec"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"text","block_content":"The variational equation (when we take the first variation on  $ P(x,y) $) leads to","block_bbox":[179,182,801,207],"block_id":0,"block_order":1,"group_id":0,"block_polygon_points":[[179.0,182.0],[801.0,182.0],[801.0,207.0],[179.0,207.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ P_{y}(x)=B(x)e^{-\\lambda\\rho(x,y)} $$ ","block_bbox":[521,225,700,253],"block_id":1,"block_order":2,"group_id":1,"block_polygon_points":[[521.0,225.0],[700.0,225.0],[700.0,253.0],[521.0,253.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"where  $ \\lambda $ is determined to give the required fidelity and  $ B(x) $ is chosen to satisfy","block_bbox":[177,273,818,297],"block_id":2,"block_order":3,"group_id":2,"block_polygon_points":[[177.0,273.0],[818.0,273.0],[818.0,297.0],[177.0,297.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ \\int B(x)e^{-\\lambda\\rho(x,y)}dx=1. $$ ","block_bbox":[514,316,707,358],"block_id":3,"block_order":4,"group_id":3,"block_polygon_points":[[514.0,316.0],[707.0,316.0],[707.0,358.0],[514.0,358.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"This shows that, with best encoding, the conditional probability of a certain cause for various received y,  $ P_{y}(x) $ will decline exponentially with the distance function  $ \\rho(x,y) $ between the x and y in question.","block_bbox":[177,375,1041,423],"block_id":4,"block_order":5,"group_id":4,"block_polygon_points":[[177.0,375.0],[1041.0,375.0],[1041.0,423.0],[177.0,423.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"In the special case where the distance function  $ \\rho(x,y) $ depends only on the (vector) difference between x and y,","block_bbox":[178,423,1045,470],"block_id":5,"block_order":6,"group_id":5,"block_polygon_points":[[178.0,423.0],[1045.0,423.0],[1045.0,470.0],[178.0,470.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ \\rho(x,y)=\\rho(x-y) $$ ","block_bbox":[535,471,684,496],"block_id":6,"block_order":7,"group_id":6,"block_polygon_points":[[535.0,471.0],[684.0,471.0],[684.0,496.0],[535.0,496.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"we have","block_bbox":[179,508,253,530],"block_id":7,"block_order":8,"group_id":7,"block_polygon_points":[[179.0,508.0],[252.0,508.0],[252.0,529.0],[179.0,529.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ \\int B(x)e^{-\\lambda\\rho(x-y)}dx=1. $$ ","block_bbox":[510,526,711,564],"block_id":8,"block_order":9,"group_id":8,"block_polygon_points":[[510.0,526.0],[711.0,526.0],[711.0,564.0],[510.0,564.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"Hence  $ B(x) $ is constant, say  $ \\alpha $, and","block_bbox":[179,578,464,601],"block_id":9,"block_order":10,"group_id":9,"block_polygon_points":[[179.0,578.0],[464.0,578.0],[464.0,601.0],[179.0,601.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ P_{y}(x)=\\alpha e^{-\\lambda\\rho(x-y)}. $$ ","block_bbox":[526,600,694,628],"block_id":10,"block_order":11,"group_id":10,"block_polygon_points":[[526.0,600.0],[694.0,600.0],[694.0,628.0],[526.0,628.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"Unfortunately these formal solutions are difficult to evaluate in particular cases and seem to be of little value.

variational equation (when we take the first variation on  $ P(x,y) $) leads to\n\n $$ P_{y}(x)=B(x)e^{-\\lambda\\rho(x,y)} $$ \n\nwhere  $ \\lambda $ is determined to give the required fidelity and  $ B(x) $ is chosen to satisfy\n\n $$ \\int B(x)e^{-\\lambda\\rho(x,y)}dx=1. $$ \n\nThis shows that, with best encoding, the conditional probability of a certain cause for various received y,  $ P_{y}(x) $ will decline exponentially with the distance function  $ \\rho(x,y) $ between the x and y in question.\n\nIn the special case where the distance function  $ \\rho(x,y) $ depends only on the (vector) difference between x and y,\n\n $$ \\rho(x,y)=\\rho(x-y) $$ \n\nwe have\n\n $$ \\int B(x)e^{-\\lambda\\rho(x-y)}dx=1. $$ \n\nHence  $ B(x) $ is constant, say  $ \\alpha $, and\n\n $$ P_{y}(x)=\\alpha e^{-\\lambda\\rho(x-y)}. $$ \n\nUnfortunately these formal solutions are difficult to evaluate in particular cases and seem to be of little value. In fact, the actual calculation of rates has been carried out in only a few very simple cases.\n\nIf the distance function  $ \\rho(x,y) $ is the mean square discrepancy between x and y and the message ensemble is white noise, the rate can be determined. In that case we have\n\n $$ R=\\operatorname{Min}\\left[H(x)-H_{y}(x)\\right]=H(x)-\\operatorname{Max}H_{y}(x) $$ \n\nwith  $ N = \\overline{(x - y)^2} $. But the  $ \\text{Max} H_y(x) $ occurs when  $ y - x $ is a white noise, and is equal to  $ W_1 \\log 2 \\pi e N $ where  $ W_1 $ is the bandwidth of the message ensemble. Therefore\n\n $$ \\begin{aligned}R&=W_{1}\\log2\\pi e Q-W_{1}\\log2\\pi e N\\\\&=W_{1}\\log\\frac{Q}{N}\\end{aligned} $$ \n\nwhere Q is the average message power. This proves the following:\n\nTheorem 22: The rate for a white noise source of power Q and band  $ W_{1} $ relative to an R.M.S. measure of fidelity is\n\n $$ R=W_{1}\\log\\frac{Q}{N} $$ \n\nwhere N is the allowed mean square error between original and recovered messages.\n\nMore generally with any message source we can obtain inequalities bounding the rate relative to a mean square error criterion.\n\nTheorem 23: The rate for any source of band  $ W_{1} $ is bounded by\n\n $$ W_{1}\\log\\frac{Q_{1}}{N}\\leq R\\leq W_{1}\\log\\frac{Q}{N} $$ \n\nwhere Q is the average power of the source,  $ Q_{1} $ its entropy power and N the allowed mean square error.\n\nThe lower bound follows from the fact that the  $ \\text{Max}H_y(x) $ for a given  $ (x-y)^2 = N $ occurs in the white noise case. The upper bound results if we place points (used in the proof of Theorem 21) not in the best way but at random in a sphere of radius  $ \\sqrt{Q-N} $.","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_50.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A06%3A04Z%2F-1%2F%2Ff984e2728a530d3d4478783bf3ac8a2eb2dee7248c544ba35feac727f05ef506"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_50.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A06%3A04Z%2F-1%2F%2F85e052721c457013072b42efd2bb4ca0d9dd687df2eb9c54bc654a7a1f281417"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"paragraph_title","block_content":"## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS","block_bbox":[515,183,708,205],"block_id":0,"block_order":1,"group_id":0,"block_polygon_points":[[515.0,183.0],[707.0,183.0],[707.0,204.0],[515.0,204.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"The writer is indebted to his colleagues at the Laboratories, particularly to Dr. H.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe writer is indebted to his colleagues at the Laboratories, particularly to Dr. H. W. Bode, Dr. J. R. Pierce, Dr. B. McMillan, and Dr. B. M. Oliver for many helpful suggestions and criticisms during the course of this work. Credit should also be given to Professor N. Wiener, whose elegant solution of the problems of filtering and prediction of stationary ensembles has considerably influenced the writer's thinking in this field.\n\n### APPENDIX 5\n\nLet $S_{1}$ be any measurable subset of the $g$ ensemble, and $S_{2}$ the subset of the $f$ ensemble which gives $S_{1}$ under the operation $T$. Then\n\n $$ S_{1}=T S_{2}. $$ \n\nLet  $ H^{\\lambda} $ be the operator which shifts all functions in a set by the time  $ \\lambda $. Then\n\n $$ H^{\\lambda}S_{1}=H^{\\lambda}TS_{2}=TH^{\\lambda}S_{2} $$ \n\nsince T is invariant and therefore commutes with  $ H^{\\lambda} $. Hence if m[S] is the probability measure of the set S\n\n $$ \\begin{aligned}m[H^{\\lambda}S_{1}]&=m[TH^{\\lambda}S_{2}]=m[H^{\\lambda}S_{2}]\\\\&=m[S_{2}]=m[S_{1}]\\end{aligned} $$ \n\nwhere the second equality is by definition of measure in the g space, the third since the f ensemble is stationary, and the last by definition of g measure again.\n\nTo prove that the ergodic property is preserved under invariant operations, let  $ S_1 $ be a subset of the g ensemble which is invariant under  $ H^\\lambda $, and let  $ S_2 $ be the set of all functions f which transform into  $ S_1 $. Then\n\n $$ H^{\\lambda}S_{1}=H^{\\lambda}TS_{2}=TH^{\\lambda}S_{2}=S_{1} $$ \n\nso that  $ H^{\\lambda}S_{2} $ is included in  $ S_{2} $ for all  $ \\lambda $. Now, since\n\n $$ m[H^{\\lambda}S_{2}]=m[S_{1}] $$ \n\nthis implies\n\n $$ H^{\\lambda}S_{2}=S_{2} $$ \n\nfor all  $ \\lambda $ with  $ m[S_2] \\neq 0 $, 1. This contradiction shows that  $ S_1 $ does not exist.\n\n### APPENDIX 6\n\nThe upper bound,  $ \\overline{N}_3 \\leq N_1 + N_2 $, is due to the fact that the maximum possible entropy for a power  $ N_1 + N_2 $ occurs when we have a white noise of this power. In this case the entropy power is  $ N_1 + N_2 $.\n\nTo obtain the lower bound, suppose we have two distributions in $n$ dimensions $p(x_i)$ and $q(x_i)$ with entropy powers $\\overline{N}_1$ and $\\overline{N}_2$. What form should $p$ and $q$ have to minimize the entropy power $\\overline{N}_3$ of their convolution $r(x_i)$:\n\n $$ r(x_{i})=\\int p(y_{i})q(x_{i}-y_{i})d y_{i}. $$ \n\nThe entropy  $ H_{3} $ of r is given by\n\n $$ H_{3}=-\\int r(x_{i})\\log r(x_{i})d x_{i}. $$ \n\nWe wish to minimize this subject to the constraints\n\n $$ H_{1}=-\\int p(x_{i})\\log p(x_{i})dx_{i} $$ \n\n $$ H_{2}=-\\int q(x_{i})\\log q(x_{i})d x_{i}. $$ ","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_51.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A06%3A05Z%2F-1%2F%2F9dc3217d0ade03992be4d4039170781e372600ae605e0b4550e5d4f4b2a0446c"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_51.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A06%3A05Z%2F-1%2F%2F0e0567ccef4d3716920e4c8466ec2c2a741a0662d46074489eb13a2520011fbf"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"text","block_content":"We consider then","block_bbox":[180,183,326,205],"block_id":0,"block_order":1,"group_id":0,"block_polygon_points":[[180.0,183.0],[325.0,183.0],[325.0,204.0],[180.0,204.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ U=-\\int\\left[r(x)\\log r(x)+\\lambda p(x)\\log p(x)+\\mu q(x)\\log q(x)\\right]dx $$ ","block_bbox":[294,220,783,260],"block_id":1,"block_order":2,"group_id":1,"block_polygon_points":[[294.0,220.0],[783.0,220.0],[783.0,260.0],[294.0,260.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ \\delta U=-\\int\\left[[1+\\log r(x)]\\delta r(x)+\\lambda[1+\\log p(x)]\\delta p(x)+\\mu[1+\\log q(x)]\\delta q(x)\\right]dx. $$ ","block_bbox":[286,268,933,307],"block_id":2,"block_order":3,"group_id":2,"block_polygon_points":[[286.0,268.0],[933.0,268.0],[933.0,307.0],[286.0,307.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"If  $ p(x) $ is varied at a particular argument  $ x_{i} = s_{i} $, the variation in  $ r(x) $ is","block_bbox":[209,325,782,350],"block_id":3,"block_order":4,"group_id":3,"block_polygon_points":[[209.0,325.0],[782.0,325.0],[782.0,350.0],[209.0,350.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ \\delta r(x)=q(x_{i}-s_{i}) $$ ","block_bbox":[536,368,683,392],"block_id":4,"block_order":5,"group_id":4,"block_polygon_points":[[536.0,368.0],[683.0,368.0],[683.0,392.0],[536.0,392.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"and","block_bbox":[179,410,218,430],"block_id":5,"block_order":6,"group_id":5,"block_polygon_points":[[179.0,410.0],[217.0,410.0],[217.0,429.0],[179.0,429.0]]},{"block_label":"display_formula","block_content":" $$ \\delta U=-\\int q(x_{i}-s_{i})\\log r(x_{i})dx_{i}-\\lambda\\log p(s_{i})=0 $$ ","block_bbox":[410,428,812,469],"block_id":6,"block_order":7,"group_id":6,"block_polygon_points":[[410.0,428.0],[812.0,428.0],[812.0,469.0],[410.0,469.0]]},{"block_label":"text","block_content":"and similarly when q is varied.

For let  $ X_{1} $ be divided into  $ X_{1}=X_{1}^{\\prime}+X_{1}^{\\prime\\prime} $ and let\n\n $$ \\begin{array}{ccc} P(Y_{1})=a & & P(X_{1})=b+c \\\\ P(X_{1}^{\\prime})=b & & P(X_{1}^{\\prime},Y_{1})=d \\end{array} $$ \n\n $$ P(X_{1}^{\\prime \\prime})=c\\quad 鳥 \\quad P(X_{1}^{\\prime \\prime},Y_{1})=e $$ \n\n $$ P(X_{1},Y_{1})=d+e. $$ \n\nThen in the sum we have replaced (for the  $ X_{1}, Y_{1} $ intersection)\n\n $$ (d+e)\\log\\frac{d+e}{a(b+c)}\\quad by\\quad d\\log\\frac{d}{ab}+e\\log\\frac{e}{ac}. $$ \n\nIt is easily shown that with the limitation we have on b, c, d, e,\n\n $$ \\left[\\frac{d+e}{b+c}\\right]^{d+e}\\leq\\frac{d^{d}e^{e}}{b^{d}c^{e}} $$ \n\nand consequently the sum is increased. Thus the various possible subdivisions form a directed set, with R monotonic increasing with refinement of the subdivision. We may define R unambiguously as the least upper bound for  $ R_{1} $ and write it\n\n $$ R=\\frac{1}{T}\\iint P(x,y)\\log\\frac{P(x,y)}{P(x)P(y)}dxdy. $$ \n\nThis integral, understood in the above sense, includes both the continuous and discrete cases and of course many others which cannot be represented in either form. It is trivial in this formulation that if $x$ and $u$ are in one-to-one correspondence, the rate from $u$ to $y$ is equal to that from $x$ to $y$. If $v$ is any function of $y$ (not necessarily with an inverse) then the rate from $x$ to $y$ is greater than or equal to that from $x$ to $v$ since, in the calculation of the approximations, the subdivisions of $y$ are essentially a finer subdivision of those for $v$. More generally if $y$ and $v$ are related not functionally but statistically, i.e., we have a probability measure space $(y, v)$, then $R(x, v) \\leq R(x, y)$. This means that any operation applied to the received signal, even though it involves statistical elements, does not increase $R$.\n\nAnother notion which should be defined precisely in an abstract formulation of the theory is that of “dimension rate,” that is the average number of dimensions required per second to specify a member of an ensemble. In the band limited case 2W numbers per second are sufficient. A general definition can be framed as follows. Let  $ f_\\alpha(t) $ be an ensemble of functions and let  $ \\rho_T[f_\\alpha(t), f_\\beta(t)] $ be a metric measuring","images":{}},"outputImages":{"layout_det_res":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/layout_det_res_53.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A06%3A07Z%2F-1%2F%2Fbffa231cf5b75c2182b6ed17a47ad139f0a7e7c16f44d96cf350dcfe61613308"},"inputImage":"https://pplines-online.bj.bcebos.com/deploy/official/paddleocr/pp-ocr-vl-15//203b83e2-fd01-4751-8c5d-72de2200a3dc/input_img_53.jpg?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2FALTAKzReLNvew3ySINYJ0fuAMN%2F2026-02-06T00%3A06%3A07Z%2F-1%2F%2F1786cf22b01acd04333bf1355c4b14206b177e17e4e24541f7de7467feaf037a"},{"prunedResult":{"model_settings":{"use_doc_preprocessor":false,"use_layout_detection":true,"use_chart_recognition":false,"use_seal_recognition":false,"use_ocr_for_image_block":false,"format_block_content":true,"merge_layout_blocks":true,"markdown_ignore_labels":["header","header_image","footer","footer_image","number","footnote","formula_number","aside_text"],"return_layout_polygon_points":true},"parsing_res_list":[{"block_label":"text","block_content":"the “distance” from  $ f_{\\alpha} $ to  $ f_{\\beta} $ over the time T (for example the R.M.S. discrepancy over this interval.)
